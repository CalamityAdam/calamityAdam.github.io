I have 118,000 in student loans, I owe about 34,000 on the house, I have 26,000 in credit card debt, I owe just under 4500 on my car.  I have about 60,000 in loans.  Things are not going so great with my husband and I have got to get out of the house with my 14 year old or I am going to crack working 2 very high demand jobs with very little help from my husband.  He struggles with mental health issues that have steadily declined since we got married 12 years ago and has never been able to keep more than a menial part time job.  I am on babystep 2 and will be doing that for years if I am not able to increase my income.  My practice is finally starting to build with 2 to 4 new patients per week.  I am just about to crack with trying to do everything and I have no idea what to do with finances or how to get my own space.  I have thought about trying to find an old RV or tiny house to put on the property.  I don't have the money to just rent another household.  I am just at a loss.  I do have the 1,000 dollar emergency fund.  I have about 3,000 left from income tax return for last year.  I have been hanging on to it because my income is all over the place.  I have 17,000 in our main business account and another 5,000 in another account where our copays go.  My SBA loan was 24000 originally, and I have no idea where I am right now with that.  My house was used as collateral.  I am sure I could come pretty close to paying off the SBA, but again, the insurance payments are not regular so I need a good level of cushion to make sure I am able to pay a few months of overhead if something comes up.  First things first, I have got to get away from my husband for awhile.  I just don't know how to do that.  Sorry, this is a little therapy, and a little financial.  But any guidance would be good.",

We live in SC and my spouse works and has income of $76k gross income and I’m disabled receiving approximately $2700 mo in SSDI & fed employee disability benefits. I’m 53 yrs old and will not be able to return to work. We have 1 child age 10. Our house was purchased at $500k in 2019 but is currently worth $820+k and we owe $200k. Mortgage payment of $1600 mo in my spouse’s name only. However my father also lives with us and his name is also on the deed (right of survivorship)  which he plans to leave to me as inheritance (he’s currently 78 yrs old). Our cars are paid for (over 10 yrs old) , combined credit card debt of  $50k,$3k in medical expenses. No other debt.  My spouse has state retirement est $50k and I have federal est $30k. No savings , not even $1k EF. Our monthly credit card payments are about $2k mon. I have separate property valued at $500k. My spouse and I cannot afford to live in separate homes and stay in our current school district. We can’t seem to work together to get the debt snowball rolling. Our current home interest rate is 2.4%. We have looked into cash out refinance mortgage to complete a basement apartment that is partially finished now and that would also consolidate all our high interest rate cc debt. This would give us $100k cash. This would change our int rate to 8% w/ mortgage $3k month but would allow us to “nest” while living separately and wouldn’t displace my father.  Or would you advise selling the house & paying off all debt, knowing that relocation to different school district and possibly state would have to occur?  This would also likely mean that 1 parent would have primary custody with the other only having visitation. I guess a 3rd option would be for me to sell my separate property (vacant land in another state)  and pay off all debt and pay for basement renovation. With a divorce looming I prefer not to do that.  The current house deed would not allow me to recoup that money in the event we have a contentious divorce. Also, once sold, I understand that the money from the sale of my separate property converts to joint ownership. ",

On top of our life pension(which is solely what we are looking at for income and is $800-1100 less each month than now), he will eventually pull ss (he will be 65 in June I will be 59 in Feb), a 403B with about 60K and I will receive 14500 1x a year for 5.5 yrs (OPEB  from district).",

I will be graduating in May 2025 and will be looking for a full-time career in sports management and event production. I currently have a girlfriend of a year and 8 months, who I plan to propose to in the next year. She will graduate in May of 2026, a year after me. She and I have discussed finances in the past and I have shown her the dangers of debt and how it can affect you for a long time in the future. She now is much more conscious about her money and spending habits, however, she will graduate a year later than me and will have approximately $30,000 in student loans and consumer debt. I know that finances do not combine until marriage, but I want to know how to best prepare for the future and transition from dating to marriage without anyone feeling jealous or guilty about money based on different starting points. With a full year's worth of income under my belt, I believe I will be able to save enough money to pay off all debts once we get married if that is what actually happens (Which I believe it 100% will). What is a good dollar amount to have saved ready to go for this big transition of my life over the next two or so years?",

    "question_body": "Hello,\n\nMy wife (33) and I (33) discovered Mr. Ramsey in 2018. We were following the steps and became debit free a year later. That’s when we stopped… we just lived our lives saving money but not putting it into retirement. We have 3 kids and life was great. Then 2020 came and the world became crazy. I made the choice to not get the needle that the army required so I was separated after 8 Years of service in 2022. So for the last 2 years we’ve hadn’t been working I’ve just been with my family making up fit the time I missed.  We had been living off our saving. Fast forward to June of this year and we bought land in Tennessee to start life again. All but 10k of what we had to our name went to the land and the rv we are currently living in. On top of that we stupidly got a loan to buy a truck to tow the trailer because I didn’t want to spend the 7k I was being quoted to get it towed. \nAll was well until a few weeks ago when my 2 year old was diagnosed with leukemia. I had just got a job that I have since lost for missing so much time while I was on probation. So now my savings is all but gone plus I owe 35k on this truck and the credit cards are maxed at 35k. My only income now an only 33k yearly which I get from the va. We have decided to move back to Arizona to have support from family while my son gets his treatment for the next 2 plus years. I guess my question is what do I do with the land we currently live on? Do I sell it to cover the debit I have or do I keep it because it is paid off and in theory its value will go up with time?\n\nContext\nMarried both 33 have 3 kids\n35k in credit cards, 35k on a truck with worth 30k, and about 7k in savings.\nMonthly income is 2700 with 2k in expenses.\nLand value would be about 50k\n\nI went from finally trying to live our dream of a homestead, to buried in debt and scared to death for my son in a matter of 4 months and I don’t know how to go about fixing this.\n\nThank you in advance and if I rambled I’m sorry, I’m a little scatter brained right now.",

Should I be investing 15% of my gross taxed pay not including housing allowance? I ask because it would significantly alter how much we save and constantly changed based on where we live (I.e. in Ohio right now it’s about $1800/mon but in Texas where we’re moving next it’s about $2300/mon). I have exclusively been using this housing money for housing and not including it for the 15% gross pay thus far. \n\nThanks!",

I really don't mind helping her since my father took care of everything including the financials and work, and since my mother isn't the type to ask for help, when she does I try to help her as much as I can. \nIn March of 2023 she decided to get a car with that money. She was driving an old 2006 Corolla and I pushed her to get the car for a kind of birthday gift.  When it came to the transactional part, I encouraged her to put about 60% and finance the rest; this was to build her credit which was somewhere in the high 300's to low 400's. I've come across the Ramsey Show just in the past month or two and binging has made me realize that I may have put her in this stressful situation of having to pay monthly instead of her having a car paid in full. \nI understand I was 18 and I was just trying to encourage her that she could get her credit up, but trying to get her out of debt with this car loan is such a hassle. Luckily, this is the only monthly payment she has to make other than bills. I know that the past is the past and my advice was only in good faith, but it's still haunting me haha.

It looks like it will take us at least 5 years to save for a house in full if we put all of our savings towards a house. I am stuck on what would we should do. I have heard Dave say that if it will take you more than 3 years to buy a house, you should also be investing into retirement. Please clarify what would be best. Thank you for your help! ",

    "question_body": "I'm 54, married, no children. We have $105,000 on a 2nd, $60,000 on a HELOC and owe $110,000 on our primary mortgage. Income is around $180,000/year (for now). Expenses are $7,000/month. \n\nMy manager has informed me I'm on the verge of being laid off. This has me considering my options for partial retirement since I'm 54, but there are so many factors to weigh. The goal here is, no shocker, financial security.\n\nWe're thinking of selling our current home and buying another one outright so we don't need to worry about losing a roof over our heads. The property taxes in our current home are steep, and the new place would have much lower property taxes.\n\nThe way I was thinking about doing this is either a full or partial cash-out of our 401K. The problem here is the 10% penalty that I'd love to avoid. I'm going to work with my manager to try to stay employed to Jan 1st when the 55 rule will kick in and I don't get hit with the penalty.\n\nBut I'm also EXTREMELY concerned about how the upcoming election could introduce market volatility and destroy the value of my 401K. They might give me an option to take a severance package (it won't be more than the 10% early withdrawal penalty) if I don't stay until next year.\n\nWhat do you think is the better option? Take the severance, collect unemployment, cash out of the 401K now to avoid the potential instability? Take a gamble on the market not going crazy, and try to stay employed until Jan 2025 and then tap into the 401K?\n\nAlso, this 55 rule has me so perplexed. Must I been employed during the calendar year I turn 55 (this would be 2025 for me) in order for the 55 rule to apply? What if I lose my job a few months shy at the end of this year? Would that mean too bad for me, and even when Jan 1st rolls around and I'm not employed I don't qualify for the 55 rule?\n\nThe plan of semi-retirement will be me doing contract work when I can get it, as well as odd jobs here and there, just to have some money coming in to cover living expense and property taxes.\n\nP.S. My childhood friend Julie and her husband Brad appeared on your show a few years back, telling their success story. It was super inspirational!",

    "question_body": "I am a 44-year-old widow raising 2 teenage girls. My husband took care of the bills for the last 20ish years, so this is quite an adjustment for me. I recently began budgeting and trying to really stick to it. There was some retail therapy happening after my husband passed, and the girls and I have realized that we have been overdoing it and need to reign it in.  I make a decent living but definitely not enough to pay all the bills on my own. Currently my daughters both qualify for survivor benefits through Social Security. These benefits end when they graduate from high school. I am putting money in their 529 plans from this and using the rest to help with bills and food, clothing, etc. Right now, budgeting is doable. My vehicles are paid for, and if I don't overspend, we do ok. My question is this: should I save every extra dollar I can in a savings account or put it toward my home loan? I have a 15 year, 2.75% fixed rate mortgage and currently owe about $57,000 (home is worth $90,000 roughly). I know I won't be able to put enough extra toward it to have the house paid off before the girls graduate, so will still have the house payment. So, is it better to pay down the house, or sock it away in a savings account to make sure I can cover the bills after the Social Security payments end but I am still trying to help/support the girls while they attend college? I do have all other debt paid, and a good emergency fund. I'm on step 6. I did tuck away money from my husband's life insurance in a CD to pay for their weddings when the time comes as well.",

No such home exists in our area. It is important to us for my wife to remain home with our daughter (and prayerfully other kids in the future) and homeschool when they get to that age. Plus, the wage my wife was making before would not cover child care in the area, and we are extremely far from any family, so that is also not an option for child care.

My question is do I \n(A) pay it off then sell it to the dealership to get a new/used car, (B) pay of most of it with no penalties and trade it in, (C) just take it in as is and trade it in with all the negative equity as they will most likely won't give us much for it. We don't want to keep make the $380 car payment on top of any problems that come up and have been expensive but don't know what's our best options and/or know the industry of cars. Can you please advise? ",

Also all of my investments are in low risk accounts with small growth, but I don't understand investing very well so I've been scared to do anything higher risk, but I've been told that I should.

Made a bad lease (too much cost) that resulted in us over budget $230 a month May-Sept. (zeroed the budget by not saving ahead for upcoming expenses - every large bill pulls from emergency fund); We have finally found enough margin (through new auto insurance and eliminating a storage unit) to reduce that to a roughly 0 based budget. Have to stick to lease through April (lease buyout charges us the remainder of the lease anyway). Question is rent or buy home.

We are trying to figure out what to do with our 401k and HSA accounts as well as savings. \n\nCurrently I put in 5% to 401k to get the company match, and then max out the HSA every year to get the tax benefits of the HSA as well as not having to worry about medical emergencies. We have about 20k in a savings account that gains 4% in interest only if we have over 10k in there. We have 20k saved which is about 4 months savings.\n\nMy husband is switching careers from a teacher to a different career at the end of the school year, and I do not feel like I have good job security at my current job, but it pays decently more and has better benefits than most other things I have looked at. Therefore, we made the mutual agreement to keep that 20k in savings. But the Ramsey method says we should use 19 of that 20 to throw at debt. Given our job and financial insecurity during this next year is that wise?\n\nNow for the 401k and HSA. Should I stop contributing to that altogether and miss out on the 10% to the retirement in the 401k and hope we don't have a medical emergency with the HSA. 401k would put about $300 extra per month, and HSA would put about $600 extra per month that we would have to throw at debt.",

So my thinking was i would be using all of the money except for $1,000 to pay for a wedding. If i choose to wait and not use the emergency fund minus the $1,000 then it would take me longer to get married. She is graduating soon and i would like to get married ASAP and start paying down all of those student loans. The thinking was regardless of the decision i make, after marriage we will be sitting at baby step 2 but using the emergency fund money to fund the wedding allows us to get married sooner and start tackling her debt sooner instead of saving for a wedding on top of the emergency fund and this would delay marriage for some time and we would still be sitting back at baby step 2 with only $1,000.

I know I have access to just about everything for this remainder of this one year. period.  I just don't know what all exactly that entails.\n\nMy question for today is this.  I'm really embarrassed to even state the situation, but my husband is currently scheduled to have open-heart surgery on 11/26/24.  We've been married since 5/3/2019 and have some things in place regarding beneficiaries for his 401K, my TSP, etc., but never got around to estate planning, trusts, etc.  We own two homes, one is Oklahoma City that is paid for under my name and one with a current mortgage in his name only at the moment.  My car will be paid off this month and is in both of our names.  His is still in his name only.  We are praying, of course, that all goes well with his surgery, bur I am panicking at the moment about what we need to get put into place regarding estate planning in the event that things do not go as planned. He has an adult daughter from a previous marriage.  I do not have children, but have a niece and two nephews that I would want my possessions to go to if anything were to happen to both of us at the same time. I know that's a lot of random info, but just throwing it all out there.\n\nCan you provide the name of a referral in the Arlington, TX, area that we can hopefully contact this next week to see what we can get done. Hopefully, once he has recovered,  we can complete everything in detail.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nCindy Martinez\n405-***-****\n",

We have a small business (he always says that we’re one) and he says that it is no necessary.

    "question_body": "Hey, 25 year old here. I have a serious girlfriend whose lease expires in July of 2025 and we plan on moving in together. I feel that I can afford a home, and don't need a financial advisor while my parents advise differently. I have been at my current job since graduation 3 years ago. I had a promotion (5-7% raise) every year in August and had a raise on top of that every year 7-10% in December. So 12-20% pay increase every year. I am at 57k a year, hourly, and I expect to be 65k this year with overtime, pre-tax. Currently, my boss has openly told me she is “grooming” me to take her position which will put my salary at 80K a year. I cannot count on this so I act like it won't increase. My only debt is student loans at 3k at 4%, and my girlfriend's only debt is student loans at <5% interest and less than 10k. She makes ~55k a year and is also on track to have an increase soon. We both budget, invest, and hate seeing the number on the screen go down. With our income and interest rate on loans, even if the market crashes we can cover our debts, so we do not pay them off.  At what point would you recommend a financial advisor? I feel like if we had the discipline to make it out of our early 20s on a budget we can continue doing what we are doing. Also, celebrating my first big financial goal of surpassing a 100k net worth next paycheck! Would it be smart for me to continue renting, from my wealthy parents, who travel for 3 months out of the year and they call me the groundskeeper? This is not a strain in my relationship as my parents have openly said I can live here as long as I want. They charge me the rent for an average apartment in the area, with a roommate, and subtract what I do to take care of the place. Gardeners $40 a mow, pool boy $100 a month, ect….   In buying a house I would ensure I have 3 months of salary set aside just in case, and until married my girlfriend and I would split the mortgage, with my name on it. We have discussed that even without combined finances we would both independently always have 3 months' pay to cover our behinds, just in case. I would also like some confirmation that im as F*** weird as I feel saving like this :). Here is my breakdown of where my finances are:\nBreakdown at next paycheck:\n\nSavings- 47k\n\nhigh yield/emergency 4.6% - 13k\n\nInvestments - 15k (2018 Nividia, misc, $200 a month s&p)\n\nTraditional 401k- 25k\n\nQuestions:\n When is a financial advisor actually worth it? If you follow a budget, are always increasing your net worth, and invest mostly in S&P is it worth the cut?\n\nIs putting yourself in a 50% debt/income for a house smart? Until married this would be 50% of MY income not including her contribution before marriage. Does following a budget, increasing your net worth, and continuing to build your “empire” change this calculation? \n",

    "question_body": "Hi! Im 34, married with 2 kids and a third in the way. We are currently on baby step 2 and are on our last $8,000 in car loan at 4.99%. After the car loan, we plan to pay off a pool loan of $38,000 at 10.99% and then a home equity loan of $77,000 at 4%. Our combined income is $230,000 a year so we have been able to put around $5,000 to $7,000 a month towards debt. (The variability here is due to my husbands business in which the monthly income fluctuates, whereas my W2 income is stable ~$190,000 a year.) \n\nMy question is this: about a year and a half ago, I agreed to co-sign on my sisters last medical school loan. This was not an easy decision for me, but she has worked really hard to get to where she’s at but is currently going through a rough divorce which is why she needed a co-signer. She has since graduated and is currently in a residency program to be an ER doctor at a local hospital. The loan started at around $110,000 at a steep 15% interest rate. Payments do not start until she finished residency but the interest accrues regardless. Her income will go from $60,000 a year to potentially 4 to 5 times that amount when she finishes and she plans to refinance the loan and remove me as a co-signer. I currently do not count this as a loan I should payoff in baby step 2. Should I? I feel like I should refinance the loan to a much lower rate (I can do this but payments would start immediately if I do). She has promised to pay me back if I decide to do this, but I’m not sure if I should. This was solely my idea because I hate seeing how much interest is accruing at the current rate. What should I do? ",

    "question_body": "Hello Mr. Ramsey and your Team! I am on my baby step 3. I am 38 years old, engaged to an amazing and beautiful woman (37), who blessed me with a wonderful 2-year-old Princess.\nCurrent Situation: We are both working full-time. Annual income after taxes 89 412 USD (48 492 USD is mine, 40 920 USD is hers). Monthly: Mine is 4041 USD, hers is 3410 USD. My net worth is 11 000 USD, at the moment, without the car and the Stocks/Crypto. Do not own a home (apartment or house). We plan to buy a home as soon as possible, as soon as we like something. We will finance it with a mortgage (30 years, not fixed rate, maximum 30-40% of home income monthly payment) and with the help of my parents (56k USD down payment from my parents, 11k USD for buying fees and taxes, 17k USD to start the repair, 28k USD will be saved for emergency). We are Renting ( 426 USD).\nThe expenses (incl. rent) which I am paying are around 3000-3500 USD for the past 3-6 months.\nNo debts, no loans.\nOwning 1 car, which is fully paid. The maintenance and insurance are a little tough. (I planned to sell it after we bought a home and put the money as an early payment of the mortgage).\nMost of the expenses (rent, utilities, monthly bills, grocery, gas, maintenance of the car, most of the time the bill restaurants, most of the vacations, etc) are paid from my monthly salary. My fiance is paying for the babysitter, the child's kitchen, the kids' clothes, for herself, etc.\nI am transferring 10% of my monthly income, to the emergency fund, but sometimes life happens and I have to withdraw from it to cover it.\nI have started to save money for our child. Each month I am saving 55 USD and planning this to increase after I changed my job.\nI have some stock investments (total value of 1500 USD). It went well because these 1500 are the profit. I have some Crypto, but it is at a loss and I left them to sleep where it is because is too risky.\nI am currently on track to build a financial plan for retirement, and child college by investing in ETF(s) every month for the next 30 years. The kid(s) college will be with a 16-year investment horizon. I will start small, at first, and will scale after I get additional income. After 30 years, I will start to unload a smaller % of the annual profit (classic scheme 4%, and leave/reinvest the rest 6%, assuming that the average return will be 10%, after inflation, which is probably very optimistic or just the enthusiasm is talking).\nSo far, we do not have a clear understanding of combined finance in the family, but we have distributed the expenses somehow. I will insist after marriage to combine our money.\nWe want to buy our place (an apartment or a house is our dream). Initially, wanted a house, but decided to be more practical and be in the city.\nWe searched and waited for a long time but unfortunately, the prices only kept going up, and here in Bulgaria they are in the sky and above.\nBut we want to buy and cannot wait anymore. So, we are actively searching. Do not get me wrong, I am fully aware that is not a good idea to buy in the current market with a big loan, but I have made up my mind and will do my best to provide for my family.\nAlso, we want to travel more, but it is very hard. So far, we are doing well, but not what we imagined.\nI got us on budget for most of the expenses which I am paying (monthly bills, grocery, etc.), but it is very hard because there is always something unexpected. I am a huge planner and love the idea for every dollar budget. Unfortunately, EveryDollar app is not available for Bulgaria, Europe.\nI need some guidance and advice in this journey to see more of the light, to hear that I am on the right path or need to change something, and just wondering if you could give me some professional advice based on the above information (everything will be of great help to me). We want to live the life we want and at the same time not be cut from our dreams. We want to provide all that is needed for our child(s) and be an example for them that everything is possible if you have a plan, dedication and discipline. I plan to teach my children to start early saving, investing, etc. Not to repeat our mistakes and our parents' mistakes. \nSome of my questions:\n1) What feedback can you give me on our finances and situation? Do you have any recommendations for us?\n2) What do you think about our plans? Do you think is possible based on the numbers and situation?\n3) What would you advise me, where to invest for our kid colleges? I was thinking in ETF, exact index replication with accumulation or distribution. But I am not sure if I can do separate accounts and separate somehow 1 account for the kid's college, 1 account for retirement, etc. Or to stick with the % distribution per goal in 1 account.\n4) Do you have any advice/s for me on how I can catch up on the lost time and increase somehow savings? We have started saving for the past 2-3 years and we do not have much.\nThank you very much for your time and wisdom!\n\n",

My husband was told by the bank we were dealing with at the time if we reinvested our earnings from the sale in purchasing a new home that it would be a tax write off. We purchased a new home put over $250,000 down payment leaving us a moorage of over $100,000 dollars. We started a new T Shirt and Hat business sinking in about $50,000 in equipment. Looking back I would  have bought all used instead of new but I digress. We have gotten our foot in the door in our new business but not exactly thriving int it. And like all others when the economy started getting worse so did our business. We went to file our taxes this year and were horrified to learn we owed over $250,000 in taxes because of the capital gains on the farm. We thought we were covered because of what the bank told us. We managed to get it down to $150,000 with some more write offs, but this about is still unattainable for us.  Before we knew about the taxes we refinanced our house to by a piece of property next to us for $30,000 to keep distance because we live in a subdivision we got $52,000 in our refinance so we paid cash for the land and paid off two credit cards, leaving us with $19,000 owed on one more card. We were barely making it. Even though I have an Air B&B in NC that is completely paid for and we both have several side jobs as well. Now we know the mountain we are going to have to climb it seems over whelming. Since learning of the taxes, my husband has got a job at Carvana. We both have second jobs and the air B&B and we are not even making our bills we do not spend a lot of money, we shop at Goodwill's and thrift stores for clothes we buy groceries at Aldi's we even use our sons $900 disability check on groceries. We don't eat out often. One of us has be home with our child at all times so me getting an extra job is impossible between his car and monthly doctor visits.

For example, after black Friday shopping you come home with 5 receipts from various stores that include personal expenses and Christmas gifts etc. Instead of manually entering each receipt and subdividing the expenses into each budget category, you can scan each receipt with the app. The algorithm/AI will generate an expense impute for each receipt and subdivide the items based on your budget titles. You can then check and edit each item before saving the expense impute.\n\nThe receipt scanner function is not necessary for the app to function so it would probably be an EveryDollar Pro feature. ",

Profiles - We launched the core profile. This is an opportunity to provide more context on who you are and where you are at on the Baby Steps. For our coaches, coordinators, and pros it's also a place to let people know how they can connect with you. If you are one of these folks and do not see a title on your profile please let me know. \n\n2. Vouches - We updated vouches to show who has vouched a reply. This was highly requested by you guys. Just click the vouches count and it will pop up! Vouch notifications in the app are in the near future as well, so less navigating back to see who vouched. As a reminder vouches are meant to signify a good answer that is aligned to Ramsey principles. \n\n3. Reactions - Another request from you guys, reactions are a way to thank, celebrate, or ask for more info. We are going to keep testing to figure out what these need to be. If you have any ideas around reactions please let me know!\n\n4. Notifications - We are currently evaluating in app notifications. These would serve as a quick way to see who was replied to you, vouched your reply, or asked a question in a topic you care about. More to come on that as we explore.\n\nI will continue to keep you guys updated and as always I would love to hear any feedback you have.\n\nYou can check out our full roadmap and request features here:\nhttps://airtable.com/app1WA88NCyPBlJLV/shrv8xVdhNfxivCex\n\nTopic: App Feedback",

I retired with 1.3M in my 401K not much in savings, and no income other than my 401K. No cc debt, a car lease 686/mo, HOA fee 800p/mo. I moved into a new condo with my dad with a 400k mort. And continued to spend like I had previously. I realized I was overspending about 3 years in, and took SS at 62 to reduce my 401K draw. My dad passed in 2022. At this point the person managing my money had it in too risky of positions and I lost about 25%. I then had 300k left in my 401K after 5 years of use. So I sold my condo took the gain and purchased a smaller condo for cash. Cut my draw from 401k from 9k to 3k/mo but still needed 2k more to live on. Tried to start 2 internet businesses which cost me 50k on cr cds.Took a small 80k mort. Just to get cash and pay of cr cds.30K in high yield svgs.so now have 560/mo mort.  Decided to go back to work. Found a great job with the city in live in -at the right time so that i dont loose SS money due to salary limits. But now am confused what to do. I'm getting SS, still getting 3k from 401K and putting into savings, plan to stop when I hit 100K in savings, deferring 45% of my new salary pre-tax into new retirement acct which the city adds 7% into. Living off SS and 55% of my paycheck. My old 401K is 259K. Am I doing the best i can do now?  I can direct the investment of the new investment account which I can likely do as well as the other guy.

    "question_body": "Hi Ramsey Solutions!\nIm 28 and my fiance is 32, we are getting married in May 2025. Everything Im about to talk about wouldnt happen until after we are married, Im just trying to plan now. We moved in with my fiance's parents a few months ago to save up for a house. Current financial position:\nMe: \nSalary $153,000\nSavings: $70,000\n401K: $157,000 (contribute 10% with 4% company match)\nRoth IRA: $10,000\nDebt (car loan): $10,000 (valued at $27,000)\n\nFiance\nHourly: average $3,000 per month\nSavings: $30,000\n401K: $10,000 (just recently started contributing, doing 10%)\nDebt: No debt (owns trucks valued at $20,000)\nInvestment account: $65,000 (left over from his parents college savings for him, plan to keep this for our kids education)\n\nOur original plan was to stay with his parents and buy a $500,000-$550,000 house once we saved enough for 20% down. His parents approached us recently about buying their house off them in approx 2 years when they retire and move our of state. Its a big, beautiful house in one of the best school districts that my fiance's dad built almost 30 year ago. The Zestimate valued it just shy of $1 million, I think it would sell for more if they wanted. \nMy fiance's dad said of course they are planning on money from the house as part of their retirement, but he more cares about us raising our kids in the same home he built for his. He mentioned they would want to do an owner financed mortgage to give us more flexibility financially as they dont have an immediate need for the money outside of a downpayment for them to fix up some things in their retirement house, which by the time this all happens we should have plenty for that. Part of the deal would be they get to stay in the finished basement when they come back to visit (completely fine with me). They have 3 houses where they plan to retire (1 to stay in, 2 rentals) so they dont have to buy a new house. We didnt get into specifics with that. They did say they are open to a tiered payment plan because they know we cant afford this house right now. So we could start paying them more once our future kids are out of daycare and we make more. \nOne issue is that my fiance has a sister that has recently cut the family off, but his dad is still holding out hope she will come back around. His mom has completely written her off and our of her will. I had a separate conversation with my fiances mom about all of this. She brought up that she wants to make sure things are written so my fiance's sister would have 0 claim to the house if they pass before we pay it off, which made me feel a bit better about all of this. \n\nI just want some advice about the best way to go about this. I know there are tax things we need to consider on both sides. Im just not sure who to talk to to figure out a plan for all of this. ",

We both contributed to the earnest money, closing costs and the utilities and insurance were both in my name alone.  At the time, my ex’s credit score was significantly higher than mine. Our loan officer advised taking the mortgage out in my ex’s name alone vs both our names because without my name our interest rate was 3.5% vs 6% with my name.  So that is what we did.   This was the first home either of us had purchased.   What I didn’t understand at the time was that the mortgage and the deed/title were two separate things, I thought it was all wrapped up together.  The plan was always that my name would be added to the property once my credit score improved, however, my ex never followed through.  We were married in 8/2/2014.  So for the first 21 months that we owned the house we were not yet married.  My ex and I had an average marriage with ups and downs like every other couple, but we overall happily married.  So it was a complete shock when my ex pulled the old “running out to grab a quick drink” and never came home.  That was 5/21/23.  He went radio silent for almost a month.  My initial reaction was that something bad had happened to him, but about a week after he disappeared I was able to confirm that he was safe at his brother’s house.  On 6/16/23 I was emailed a divorce petition.  In the petition my ex is stating he has a non-marital claim to the house.  We finally have our day in court this Monday.\nMy ex has not lived in the house since 5/21/23, I have remained in the home and have been paying all of the housing costs.  I have a copy of our lease agreement from the apartment that we lived in prior to buying the house, emails between myself and the realtor we used, (my ex was not included in those), emails from the inspector addressed only to the realtor and myself, as well as proof that the utilities have always been in my name.  Will this be enough to invalidate his non-marital claim? Or is this a lost cause?  \n",

I live with my parents, only have $300 to pay off on my credit card which I could do at any point and I probably should do that asap, I pay for my monthly car payments and the insurance. I have no other debts or bills. I have a girlfriend who doesn’t currently have a job but is looking around. She’s just starting college, has no car and no money. With my settlement, I have been told by a banking investor friend of my dads to put it in a CD with a high APY and just leave it in there and contribute all my future settlement payments to it. However, I have also been told to start my Roth IRA young and contribute monthly payments as well as my settlement payments. I’m not sure which one to do. My goal is to work hard now and save up/invest a good chunk now while I’m young, then buildup my wealth and hopefully be able to pass it down. I want to keep my credit score high, pay off whatever house I’m going to get, pay off my car, my credit card, and be a millionaire when I retire.

    "question_body": "Hello, Mr. Ramsey, and staff! Here's my predicament... I know I have to reconcile my taxes from 2023 & will have to reconcile 2024's, but I need your advice/help VERY much. I got divorced 11-27-23 but my ex filed \"our\" taxes \"Married Filing Jointly\". I thought that since I don't have any income and I was his dependent for 11 months, it wouldn't matter. But we had/have Marketplace Health Insurance so I've learned that I should have filed my own taxes, even though I have no income. I DO get $500 a week from a divorce settlement but that CANNOT be claimed as income, according to the IRS. I don't remember why, but my health insurance stopped (and also restarted, when I had JUST met my deductible) from being $0 a month to $650 a month on October 1, 2024. I have made one payment of $650 to pay October's. But I still owe November & December and although they say I still have insurance, they're not paying for anything and the bills are adding up VERY quickly. You see, I have Stage IV, metastatic breast cancer in 3 places in my spine and a spot on my 4th left rib. I just started treatment about 2 months ago. But I have to go get a port draw (bloodwork) every two weeks to see how my body is doing with treatment, where my levels are, etc. I also go and see my oncologist, get an infusion, and get hormone blockers every month. I'm up to $100,000 to pay for treatments and tests just since October. I've spoken with my ex-husband's accountant and she is supposed to be checking into filing an amendment to last year's taxes and filing mine (I pray). My problem is that I don't have health insurance paying for healthcare, although I am receiving care at insurance prices, so I'm grateful for that much. And although the IRS says I have no income, the federal government says that my divorce settlement is a gift each month, so I can't get any federal help with Medicaid, etc. So what do I do??? I also need to write out my will because of the cancer. I own my own home, a 2011 Terrain, have no debt except hospital/medical bills. I live very simply, but could still cut back on little things if I have to. I just need help with my medical situation. I'll also say that God is HUGE in my life and I know He provides, but sometimes He wants us to do something, too. I need to know what that is. I believe I have a Calling on my life and my home (which is a fixer-upper), but now that I have cancer, I don't know if I'm going to be around or if He's going to call me Home. I can see it going either way. I THINK He wants to keep me around because I'm learning sooooo MUCH in my Bible studying and what the Holy Spirit is speaking to me. But, I could be wrong. Things that seem sensible to us are not God's way of doing things. So maybe this health insurance thing is a test of faith and a test of me needing to ask for help/humility. I just need to know that I'm doing my part while I'm also trusting Him. Oh, I also can't file for Disability (I've tried) because of the \"gift\" my ex \"gives\" me each month. Along with the cancer, I also have Major Depressive Disorder with Panic & Anxiety, Type 2 Diabetes, Asthma, ADHD & OCD, that list goes on, too. The devil is charging at me from every direction. I've got my armor on but I'm trying to build fortified walls, also. Thank you, in advance, for any advice/help you can give. Also, I'd like to join one of your plans but I'm already behind with money, so I don't think that would be smart.",

I also once worked for Doordash on the side until an unfortunate accident ended that side hustle. My expenses were killing any chance of debt payment or savings at the time. I was able to buy a used vehicle from my ex boss for $500. But due to the number of car accidents I've had over the years, to start having personal car insurance would take me $600 a month. My debts are over $90,000, mostly medical debt. I've been looking for work but haven't found any yet. While looking, my money has run out and my auto insurance has lapsed, so I can't currently use the car. To sell it,though, would be foolish, because that's my only way of getting around, and selling it means that I would have to borrow to get another one. I'm not lazy or prideful. I'll take a job at a car wash right now. All I need is the $600 it would take to start my car insurance to find better work in any spare time I would have. My problem, amidst all this, is that I can't even find part time work in the small town I love in because there aren't many open jobs in my town (I check on 5 job apps, the newspaper, and 3 legit job related websites).

My husband doesn't have benefits at his job, and we never could save for our retirement. When I started working FT 5 years ago, I opened a 401K, but borrowed half of what I had, to cover our expenses, since I left my job  after being there 4 years. I opened my business and am making almost twice as much, but I am not sure if we should save to buy a house now that we're 50, or continue to rent .If we own our house, I could double my income, but I would triple the amount I would pay for my mortgage. I also feel the urge to save for our retirement,  since we don't have more than $8,000. My husband and I think that buying a lot and installing 1-2 manufactor homes would be another option. Our mini van broke down and we also need an suv, as we go out as a family every week, and sometimes go out with my parents. The way we have been doing this is by driving 2 cars and meet at a certain place.\n2 of our sons will be going to college in 1-2 years, and I feel that we need to support them before they get student loans. \nI feel that there's so much on our plate, and we are finally making a decent amount of money and we want to use it wisely. Our total debt amt is approximately $29,000.\nShould we continue to rent, and save for our retirement in a ROTH (but the contribution is limited). Also, how to avoid paying so much ti IRS? PLEASE HELP US MAKE SMART DECISIONS.  THANKS IN ADVANCE!\n",

I currently have $35,000 in my 457 and am considering converting it (my employer does NOT match any contributions to this one) to my Roth IRA but have some questions/reservations:\n\nIs it worth losing the Social Security money I receive? I only qualify for 3 monthly payments anyway of $1350 due to my income (which is approx. 45,000 this year). I believe they reduce my SS payments $1 for every $2 I earn over the limit. These only continue until my children graduate high school. Could it change the amount my children receive? They receive payments all 12 months. I think it's only based on their own income but am not 100% certain.\n\nWill it drastically reduce the Financial Aid that my daughters and I will qualify for? I've been told that with my income level, we should qualify for several grants.\n\nI can file as a qualifying widow for 2024 and 2025. My husband passed in 2023, and I was able to file as married since he worked for part of the year.\n\nI'm just wondering if it would be a good time to convert now, while I have the qualifying widow filing status and will stay in the lower tax bracket or if by converting, I will mess up opportunities for me and my children to get help with college. I'm on baby step 6 and am set up to have my mortgage paid off in a few months. I have saved some for the girls' college, but not a lot (approx. $8000 and $7000). I recently have been thinking about going back to school myself but haven't saved anything specifically for college for me yet. I could use some advice from anyone that knows what this could do to our FAFSA.\n\nOr do I sit tight and convert slowly, a little at a time, once my children have graduated? I'm just concerned that delaying will potentially not make converting worth it, as I was planning to retire at age 62. I planned to make my future contributions to the Roth and either stop or significantly decrease my contributions to the 457.  \n\nAny advice on any of these questions/thoughts is much appreciated. I have tried to be very strategic with the limited resources I have. It's just hard to know what the best option is here. I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can for my children but also taking care of my future self.",

Im considering having a conversation about having my business purchase his business whish is essentially closed or having the farm contract my company to manage so that I can continue to utilze my current LLC. Is this overcomplicating things?",

If we move, it will cost for closing on a home and our interest rate will be higher at todays going rate so we’re not sure if it’s worth us trying to sell or just stick it out pay off the mortgage and just pay the HOA fees cause most HOA fees in Florida Southwest are anywhere between $500 to $1200.

What would be the best way to pay off our HELOC?\n\nWe have $979 monthly that we can apply to a payment. Should we keep the HELOC and just make larger payments and no withdrawals? Should we refinance our HELOC to a second mortgage? Accept the money my mom has offered to pay off the HELOC in full and pay the interest back to her instead? Use a credit card to pay off the HELOC at 16% interest? \n\nWe are so lost and confused and there is almost no information we can find to help us. Please help!",

And the mortgage on our house which is $900 a month 3% rate \nOther bills electric trash phone internet etc equal $450 a month.I’m wondering if we should pay this car off now or wait and save the cash for purchasing our next home. We make 100k a year combined. We want a nicer house and plan on spending about 275-375k on our next home. And putting atleast all of our equity from the old house down on the new house. Perfect credit scores on both sides high 800s should we wait to buy a new house till interest rates go down hopefully? Should we pay the car off now or keep the lower interest payment and cash in the bank. \n\nOn another side note through my employer. Offers health care we have chosen the most expensive plan to get through the pregnancy which we did. It cost $5,400 a year and the benifts are really good almost nothing to go to doctors etc. out of pocket max 5k \n\nThey also have the cheapest plan at $1,237 a year they contribute $1,700 a year into a hsa account with an out of pocket max of 7k. From my understanding standing This plan would only work for some one who can pay the medical bills till you reach the out of pocket max. However we are in a situation to pay those if needed. This plan has a overall cheaper yearly cost even in a worst case scenario from what I understand should I change to this plan to take home more on my pay checks and potentially save some money every year?",

I have about 20K I can take a loan against my 401K to use for the credit card debt and personal loan that total about $19,000.

    "question_body": "I recently moved out of state with my 4 boys to live with my sister after the passing of my husband in August 2024. I had to move because his body was found in the apartment while the kids and I were away visiting family.  His family blamed me for his death. For our mental and psychological wellbeing, I had to move away leaving my jobs where I was earning decent wages. I ended up breaking the lease, but the apartment complex understood so they didn't put that on my credit history. I am currently unemployed while waiting for my nursing license to be processed.  I have a $22,000 student loan in forbearance status right now because I'm unemployed, plan on paying the interest to prevent higher loan amount. I have paid off all of my credit card debts !!! but have 1 derogatory collection on my credit which I have reached a payment arrangement with the debtor- that should be paid off in 3 months ($3900) It has been very difficult living with family especially when you have little ones   (I've cried many nights sad for my kids to have to live somewhere where they're not happy ) I'm planning on purchasing a home, preferably a multifamily home. (my credit score is fare 647 as of today but the paid off cc debts has not yet reflected on my account. I am receiving $4000/month from Social Security for the boys. Should I go ahead and apply for the mortgage now or wait until the decreased debt reflects on my credit? I have $9000 in emergency funds, and I am in the process of inheriting my husband's pension fund approx. $15,000. O had planned on saving the pension for the kid's college because I was expecting to stay with my sister for a longer period of time, work and save up some money but not anymore. A peace of mind for the kids and I surpasses anything at this point. Please help me navigate my life!!!\n ",

    "question_body": "I recently signed with a debt consolidation company with a law firm. I had so much credit card and personal loan debt from helping my family and my children that I was getting nowhere. I was paying for it all each month, but the interest and debt was so high that I was just a hamster on a wheel. I was living paycheck to paycheck with no emergency fund or any type of savings. I figured going this route was better than filing bankruptcy. So essentially, I stop paying everything and then the law firm settles the accounts with the lenders for a lesser amount. I have to pay the consolidation company each month I think for four years for them to have the money to settle the debt, but it is one third of what I was paying monthly for all of the debt before, and it will save me about $50,000 total. I know this will hurt my credit, but I am hoping that it will be ok since I am paying them a settlement, and that I can rebuild my credit in a quicker time frame. I hope I made the right decision. I did not know what else to do. I was struggling to live. So now I am starting my financial journey with the baby steps, and I will not be taking on any debt ever again if I can help it. I am downloading the everydollar app, creating a budget, saving the $1,000 for the first step as fast as I can, and then plowing through the rest of the debt we have. I did not include my personal  line of credit or my care credit card. Those 2 are about $4700 together. Then, my wife has one credit card and a small student loan. She has really good credit so we did not include anything of hers so that one of us keeps a really good score. I am the sole provider. I am a RN so I make a very good annual salary. Without that huge debt, we will be able to accomplish a great deal I think. I guess I just want to get your opinion on everything. Do you think I am on the right track or was this a horrible decision? Do you have any suggestions that I should take into consideration. Thank you for your time.",

My wife is telling me I should leave sooner than later to take advantage of the pay difference at a younger age and take the lower annuity and possibly make more in the private sector and use more of my money to resolve debt.

We purchased the house two years ago with a 20% down payment at a 5.5% interest rate. We also have $64,500 in total car debt.\n\nOne truck I did a $20,000 down payment now has $30,000 balance left with three years left on the loan and zero interest. It currently sells for $45,000. We recently also purchased a Tesla with a $4,500 down payment and a $34,500 balance with five years left on the loan but at a higher 6.89 interest rate. It could be sold for its full loan amount.\n\nMy wife earns $160,000 annually, while my income fluctuates as a full-time realtor. In 2022, I earned $120,000, $56,000 in 2023, and $33,000 in 2024. However, with my current pipeline and active clients, I expect to earn more than $60,000 this year. My business is looking much better this year. \n\nWith that said I’m considering selling the truck and Tesla to use the cash to buy a used vehicle under $10,000 for my wife to drive. I would also be taking over my parents beater ’ 2005 Escalade ESV, which has over 240,000 miles and burns 12 mpg. It’s been in the family since new and has been well-maintained because take care of all car repairs myself, having former dealer mechanic background.\n\nBy selling the current truck and Tesla, we would still have two vehicles. Our monthly expenses, excluding gas for my truck, are $1,521. During the slow season months, gas cost for my truck is $200 monthly, while during the busy real estate season, they increase to around $280.\n\nGiven these circumstances, would it be wise to sell the truck, especially since it’s essentially almost half-paid off? My wife currently has $8,000 in cash, while I have less than $1,000. I’ve stopped contributing to my Roth IRA and currently have only $10,000 in it. Robinhood also has $10,000, but that’s with a $40,000 loss, so it doesn’t seem like a good idea to sell those either.

We have weekly budget meetings and good communication on finances. \n\nWe have our camper and personal home to pay off. We have the camper in a seasonal site in the summer which reduces my travel to work (one way 1.5 hr to 30 min)  I am a nurse at a University, the pay and benefits are worth the driving. \n\nI have used EveryDollar since May 2021. My question is in regards to monthly budgeting. I am having a hard time managing quarterly bills. I break it down and put in EveryDollar monthly. We don't really move that money to another account. My husband \"keeps this money as a  buffer in his account\" as he pays the household bills.  I am okay with that but I am the nerd and that is to vague for me.  \n\nAny Thoughts or Suggestions?\nJanet",

I know the next step is to fully fund my emergency fund but my mortgage payment is nearly 42% of my net income and over 27% of my gross income. Even if I am debt free, I will still struggle to make my payments each month, especially when I get to the step of reinstating my retirement to 15% of my income. Additionally, the reason I am doing this program is to financially become able to change careers, which is definitely going to lower my income, ultimately. My question is... should I do a 'Mortgage RE-CAST' (a minimum of $10,000 is needed for this) and include this in my 'debt payoff' before I move on to the next steps? ... And if not, what is the proper way to deal with this situation? I am worried because it will take me a while to save up even 3 months of income for my fully funded emergency fund (which would also be $10,000) and I will still be paying my mortgage at this rate...

Not against marriage but no real reason to push for it - unless it could somehow benefit us financially? We currently have $34,000 in credit card debt (6 cards averaging about 27% interest) and owe ~$10,000 on a truck that is  worth about that much but is awful on gas and not necessary for us to own. Our monthly payment is $470. We also owe $28,000 to a family member who is not strict about us paying them. We own our house (loan from family member helped us build it) but our income is very unstable as we prioritize being together as a family and my partner was out of the country for some time competing in a game show. So this is where my main question comes in, he won $40,000 on that show, we had a $10,000 advancement that we used to pay off one card and spend on daily life expenses. So now we have $30,000 that we still have to pay taxes on, but want to use to tackle our debt and start an emergency fund - step one. Do we use the full $30,000 and find a way to pay taxes when that time comes? Or assume to pay about 40%, set that aside and only use what’s left to pay towards cards? And if so do we still follow step 2 and pay off the smallest cards first? Or pay off the truck? Or sell the truck? Just looking to make the best decision with the money that we have. ",

    "question_body": "My job where I was working as a winemaker was eliminated in March of 2024. I was earning $120,000 per year and am now unemployed. There are very few wineries in this area. I have applied for many winemaker positions in  other areas of the country but have had no luck so far. I have made wine for about 40 years. I have also applied for jobs outside the wine industry locally but again, no luck so far. I am 60 years old and am kind of feeling like my working days are over even though I do want to continue working. \n\nMy wife is working as a medical coder and her wage is $30/hour. She works from home and she will be 57 in March. She is putting 10% or her paycheck into a Roth 401k and 10% into a traditional 401k and she gets a 4% match. \n\nWe have investment accounts at Fidelity (some of which is managed by Fisher) and at Stifel. The balance of our investment accounts is currently at about $711,000 and we have a money market account which is earning about 4.5% with $226,000 in that account. We have about $5,000 in savings and checking as well. We are doing ok overall financially despite me not working at this time but we are spending a bit more than my wife is bringing home each month. We have not been the best at pinching every penny by any means and my wife tends to be less willing to work on that than I am. We have been married 24 years and I have learned that the health of our marriage is worth more than ragging on her to spend less. It is not easy to have budgeting type conversations with her without them getting heated.\n\nI struggle with feelings of worthlessness due to me being unemployed. I have contributed significantly to our financial health over the years and my wife is sweet and supportive but I hate being in this forced situation. \n\nI have some medical issues that prevent me from doing some types of work and at this stage in my life I confess that I am not willing to do just any job, especially since we do not really need for me to work.\n\nWe need to decide if I should apply for Social Security at 62 or if we should delay that. If we delay that then we will deplete our money market account faster. That money is from the sale of our previous home when we lived in Michigan and from additions from my last job.\n\nAnother significant piece of our financial future is that my father and step-mother have transferred title of their home in Ecuador into our names. We have visited them 3 times so far and we do anticipate moving down there when they pass away if not sooner. If we do so sooner then we would probably rent a place and then move into their home (now our home since the title is in our name). It is a large, custom built home that is exquisite. We could probably easily sell it for $500,000 and possibly up to a million or so but as I said we will likely live in the home ourselves when the time comes. My parents in Ecuador live on just their Social Security payments which amount to about $4500 per month. My SS payment will be about $2200/month if I retire at 62 and my wife's will be about $1600/month if she retires at 62. She may delay retirement until 65 or so but it does depend on when my parents in Ecuador pass away.\n\nRight now, despite feeling bad about not working and about living in a dump of a mobile home that we are renting we do feel pretty confident and comfortable with our future financial prospects. Especially in light of our plan to retire eventually to Ecuador and into a lovely fully furnished home with a very low overall cost of living. We could most likely live on just our SS payments and never touch our retirement accounts but we do want to do quite a bit of traveling during retirement. \n\nI am writing to you at this time mainly to get your thoughts about us buying a home soon despite me not working. Assuming I will not work again should we buy a home or just keep renting? Neither of us is very content with our living situation. It is much worse than in times past and we are both unable to pursue some of our hobbies due to our living circumstances. If we had our own home we would be able to pursue those hobbies again and would enjoy our lives more fully. \n\nIn order to finance the mortgage we would pay it out of our money market account which would obviously deplete that account faster. If we buy a $300,000 house here in Arkansas and put 25% down then I figure the money in the money market account will last about 3 years. If I delay applying for Social Security until a few months before the money market accounts funds run out then I would pay the mortgage and other living expenses with my SS payments and start dipping into my retirement funds as needed. I currently have about $120,000 in my Roth account.\n\nWe have no children at all and zero debt.\n\nShould we buy a house now even though I might never work again?",

    "question_body": "Hello, I’m 29yo, I live in Hong kong (though not native), I’ve been here for 6y, and am getting married this year to a HongKonger. \nMy salary is upward of 70k USD, my soon to be wife’s is about the same. We’re debt free. \nWe’re really struggling with the decision to buy a flat. We currently rent (monthly rent = 15% of our 2 incomes). The reason for the struggle is how expensive the hong kong real estate market is (one if not the highest sqf price city in the world). With your recommendation of 15y loan / 20% downpayment / monthly payment of 25% of household income, that means our budget would be 575k (USD). At that price in Hong kong, that equates to an apartment likely less than 500sqf in an disadvantageous location, and an old building… it seems like paying too much for not enough. \nI’d like to ask for your advice on wether or not you think we should still go for it? \nAlso, we tried to do some math on having 15y mortgage vs a 25y one and investing the difference in payments to be compounded. We got lost in our calculations and weren’t able to clearly assess which is the best option. Would you be able to rationalise why you think it is not a winning move to extend the mortgage ? ",

My brother is only home on the weekends due to his work schedule, so to help him financially he stays in one of our rooms and in return helps us with some normal bills. Initially when we got this house, it was big enough for us. But now with our second child turning 7, and our first 11, we are feeling squeezed in our 4 bed house. I managed to refinance our home to 2.25% fixed mortgage and pay extra each month. We bought land in 2021 for $75,000 (paid off) so that we could build a bigger home. All my debt is paid off except $215,000 on the mortgage and maybe $2,000 in credit cards. My fiance has a little more debt maybe $20,000 total with car loan and credit cards. Together we make around $12,000 per month. \nNow with the cost of everything going up we no longer see a path forward to building a bigger home when interest rates are so high. \nShould we push forward to build a home that works for us?

We have a paid for home worth $385,000, investments worth 1.8 million dollars and we have $5,000 in our checking account and $50,000 in a high yield savings account. With our retirement and social security payments monthly, we get a little over $8,000 per month. \n     We adopted a little girl when she was a baby, she’s 11 now. We also have four grown adult kids in their 40’s. Three of the older kids have nothing to do with us because they feel our adopting our daughter cut into their inheritance. They were told they’ve got all they’re getting from us, we gave all four $100,000 towards their homes. \n     Fast forward, my husband has early onset dementia. He’s had it about five years and is declining. I’m providing care for him at home so far and, I’m also caring for our 48 year old son that will more than likely be on hospice soon. \n     Our daughter is a true blessing. She has neurological issues and mild Aspergers. I have so many appointments for all of them and I’m to the point of exhaustion. I have to place my son and husband and put my health and our daughters health first now. \n     My son’s care will be covered by insurance. My husband will be private pay. I found a facility and the cost will be between $7,000 and $9,000 per month.  Due to having an 11 year old, I’m very concerned about finances. I don’t know where to start. Our daughter is very high functioning and will be independent. I’m paying about $2,500 per month for a private school and tutoring. We also private pay eye and dental care for her. I have a college account set up for her of $200,000 that’s in a stock portfolio and doing well. We have a protection trust we sat up years ago. Our daughter will be the beneficiary of our estate and we have everything protected. \n     My question is, how do I go about paying for memory care for my husband? I only spend about half of our monthly income and, we live a very comfortable life. Do I just start using the savings account and let the surplus from that accumulate monthly. \n     I feel heartbroken having to place my son and husband but, I’ve taken care of my son for eight years and my husband five. I’m emotionally and physically worn out and, my daughter needs a more happy home type environment, not a care facility to live in. \n     Thank you in advance for your suggestions. It’s because of you we live this well. I am very generous with giving to our Church and the school my daughter attends. My daughter donates her time at a local shelter. \n\nLinda",

Is there a point where you decide the Blue Book Value of the auto does not support your decision to keep patching it up to drive instead of buying another new one? This one was purchased brand new by me and all maintenance has been kept. It has 300,000 mile so it and is currently in the dealer shop waiting my decision to fix the door latch for between $680 and $1190 depending on the labor required to get the door open to fix the latch. When it messed up, I was locked IN the automobile on the driver side. When I made my exit out the driver side, the auto locks were engaged and locked me out of ALL doors. Wrecker drivers could not get it open, so it was towed to the dealer. My budget does not allow for a new automobile, but my budget does not allow for me to keep patching this auto up either. The last patch $1450 was 11-20-2024 when the alternator went out. Prior to that, I have not had too many repairs other than AC a couple of times. All work on this automobile has been done through a certified dealer (same dealer for the past 16 yrs), so when does a person stop patching an older auto just to keep from carrying an automobile note? Waiting for input. Thank you in advance!  ",

My youngest is still living at home and has worked as my home health aid for over 6 years. I want him to be able to fly the coop and pursue his own life now that he’s finished college and I also want to move south to be closer to my grandchildren.\n\nI had a stroke in my spinal cord in 2011 and have been on SSDI since 2012, and Medicare since 2014. After years of therapy I am blessed to be able to walk unassisted now, but do have a home health aid for assistance. I also have a rare genetic bone disease and am on an extremely expensive treatment, so I rely on a Medicaid aged and disabled program for the home health and for extra help covering the costs of my medications. (just under 4 million a year) \n\nIn early 2014, my husband went in for neck surgery. What was to have been an overnight stay ended up being 6 weeks in ICU for multiple complications and further surgeries. When he finally came home it was with a significant hypoxic brain injury. As we only had my small SSDI coming in, I first sold one vehicle to help keep us afloat. Then I did a hardship withdrawal of his 401K so I could continue to pay our mortgage and utilities. I applied for SSDI for him and thankfully he was approved pretty quickly. He passed away in 2017 from related complications. \n\nIncome-wise I receive my SSDI and also a percentage of what my husband’s SSDI was as his disabled widow (SSWD) I recently started drawing one of his small pensions. I also work about 4 hrs per month doing light filing for a local business, which qualified me for a Medicaid Buy-In for Workers with Disabilities program. It lowered my monthly Personal Liability costs to maintain the secondary Medicaid costs significantly. \nI owe $30,000 on my mortgage at 2.8% and have one remaining credit card with a balance of $7K on it that I am paying extra on each month. I got the higher interest rate ones paid off first. My assets are limited due to Medicaid rules. Once I get the last credit card paid off, I plan to open an ABLE Account (which doesn’t count as an asset) and have one of the SSDI checks deposited into it so I will have a safety net for unexpected expenses.\n\nI plan on selling my home and buying a home in GA to be closer to my son and his family. The tricky part is the timing of getting my home here sold and purchasing a new home there, otherwise the proceeds from selling my house will put me way over the resource limits. \nMy question is what are my best options for the purchase of the new home?

I asked the employer to switch me to the pension plan but they are asking me to pay $27k out of pocket on top of what I have in my investment plan to buyback the pension plan as they said that due to the pandemic in 2020-2021 my investment plan didn't performed well. They sent me  a letter with financial projections showing that under the pension plan, I would receive a monthly pension check of around $2,400 if I retire at age 65 or $1,800 if retiring at age 62. \n\nPaying $27k to buyback a pension plan will represent emptying my emergency fund savings. I'm just looking for a stable monthly check when I retire in addition to social security. Would this will be a good move to buyback the pension plan or keep myself in the investment plan?",

I asked the employer to switch me to the pension plan but they are asking me to pay $27k out of pocket on top of the $28k I have in my investment plan if I want to switch to the pension plan. They sent me a letter with financial projections showing that under the pension plan, I would receive a monthly pension check of around $2,400 if I retire at age 65 or $1,800 if retiring at age 62.\n\nPaying $27k to switch to this pension plan will represent emptying my emergency fund savings. I'm just looking for a stable monthly check when I retire in addition to social security. Would switching to the pension plan by paying $27k be a good idea or should I keep the investment plan?\n",

    "question_body": "My parents are 79 years old and looking into a senior living community in the Denver, CO area.  They do not currently need nursing care and can live on their own.  The independent living part of this community has a payment structure that sounds strange to me.  They would pay a large \"buy-in\" amount (it varies by unit size, but around $500,000.  Then they are required to pay about $6,000 per month while living there to cover rent, utilities, 1 meal per day at one of the restaurants on the campus, use of facilities and use of the on site shuttle.  If they pass away or decide to move out, 90% of the buy-in amount is returned to them or their estate.  The $6000 per month seems outrageous for what it covers and the buy-in makes no sense to me.  It is not used to cover any of their expenses or even available to them.  Any investment growth on that sum apparently belongs to the company as does the 10% they keep when my parents leave or pass away.  So, this could be several hundred thousand dollars (depending on how long my parents may live there) that goes to the company instead of my parents estate.  I am wondering if this is completely normal or if this is the scam that it looks like to me.",

    "question_body": "I’m 51 and will be retiring this year with a state retirement. My investment account consists of a pension converted to a market investment plan. A component of this is the option to use a self directed brokerage account vs leaving the money in the funds managed by the state. This is the Florida Retirement System (FRS) to be clear. \n\nThe Investment Plan which I label as “state managed” is actually managed to a certain degree by me. I have the power to direct my funds into specific mutual funds but I’m very limited in options. Most are target date funds with the remainder being FRS exclusive index, bond, and inflation proof funds. Their rate of return, collectively, is underwhelming but likely reliable. In other words, they’re not likely to beat the S&P 500. \n\nThe self directed brokerage account (SDBA) lets me move all (except $5000) of my funds from the state managed side to an account with significantly more available funds at my disposal. \n\nNow that I’ve explained all that, I’ll ask my question!  Say I want to use Dave’s advice and invest my funds into the 4 types of mutual funds, does that imply I should only use 4 funds or is fine to split each 25% of the pie into smaller slices?  If 2 funds in the international segment, for example, were similar in fees and returns but held different stocks, would I be fine buying each fund or do I pick one and run with it?\n\nI’m fairly confident in my ability to research and choose mutual funds but I’ve only been learning with my Roth  account which has only $5k in it. My retirement plan will have far more. Thanks!",

If I have the $23,000 in cash without any assistance from my grandmother, should I pay for the new asset in cash or should I look into a personal loan of that amount so I don’t take the immediate financial hit.

We have a mortgage on our home (home value is ~$400k / outstanding loan is ~$350k). Our combined income is ~$160k. I have $1000 saved in emergency fund. We have an additional vehicle (Jeep) worth ~$7k (no lein) that I want to sell. We have an RV worth ~$40k (no lein) that I want to sell. We have a rental house where we should clear ~$80k when we sell. I am planning on selling the RV and the house in early Spring.\n\nQuestion...should I sell my truck (worth ~ $20k) and keep the Jeep and use that $7k to snowball the debt or should I sell the Jeep and use that $7k to pay off the Credit Card and use the balance towards my truck. Once we sell the house and one of the cars and the RV, which should all be done no later than April, we will be debt free with a very good start on Emergency Fund.\n\nThe Jeep is 2016 and has ~70k miles. The Truck is 2022 with only 40k miles.\n",

I have extra left over that I invest. I have an emergency fund of 6 months if something ever happened to the trust in a high yield savings account.  How should I be handling my money?",

I am presently contributing 36% to my Roth 401K at work. My employer does a 4.5% match.  I’m wondering if I should reduce that amount back to 15% while I am trying to pay off my mortgage.

The outstanding mortgage balance is $136,000. Home Value is @$450,000.  Current Line of Credit is $110,564.00.  (The LOC earns the same rate of interest that the mortgage balance is charged. It s a variable rate. And we can access the LOC fiunds income tax free, of course.)\n\nWe have two paid for vehicles...a 2024 Hyundai Palisade (Large SUV) and a 2006 Sebring Convertible, that my wife loves and will not let me replace. I paid cash for the SUV when I retired in January 2024.\n\nBoth of my adult children (46 and 40)  live in different states (TX and MD)  and they will never move to NC to live in the home.\n\nMy point...WHY would I want to pay off this home?  I have the money to do it but to ME, it doesn't make financial sense to do it.\n\nIncome wise, we have $74,340 in Social Security income, $36,000 annuity income, (80% is income tax free, because they most of it was funded with Roth dollars) RMDs for 2025 totaled  $15,460 (Most of which will become QCDs)  and we have $565,000 in Vanguard's  ETFs (VTI / VXUS ETFs...100% liquid.)  Our annual retirement expenses, including charitable giving ,but  not travel, total @ $60,000. \n\nFor 2024 Taxes, we are anticipating a 12% bracket and @$4,500 refund from Federal Taxes.   For 2025, we are looking at @10% Tax Bracket.  And if President Trump delivers on his promise to remove income taxes from Social Security benefits, that will be an additional $7,000 in tax free income.\n\nI honestly see no financial advantage to paying off the $136,000 mortgage.  The mortgage is a non-recourse loan, there is never a mortgage payment due, (until we die, move, or sell the home,) and we can never owe more on the mortgage than the value of the home. Period.\n\nAm I missing anything?  Why would I want to pay off the mortgage?\n\nThanks for your response.",

I have about 75,000$ in retirement (private prsa pension in Europe) , 55,000$ in savings (invested in etfs). \nI have 2 properties in my home country. \nOne property is on my name but with no right to sell while my parents are alive -value at 120,000$. \nSecond property is valued at around 145,000$, however i still have mortgage on it of about 60,000$. This property is rented out and pays part of my mortgage-350$ out of 600$.\nI am renting a place in the country where i live for 800$. Average rent here is 1600$ so i am saving a lot by not moving out. \n\nI need help to decide what is the best next step for me. I earn 150,000$ a year. I am thinking of buying a property in the city where i live now , price around 350-380,000$. Should I sell my etfs for getting the money for the down payment or should I sell my other property in the other country and use the cash difference from that transaction? My monthly payments if i get a mortgage will increase as mortgage payments will be about 1,400$ while my rent is 800$. \nThank you ",

In the past I had a TBI and was able to overcome and get back to work after a few years of dedicated neurotherapy, cognitive, feedback, etc. This time around I have been not able to break through which is due to past head injury. I'm confident I can in time. While on Disability I have been able to pay bills, and mortgage. \n\nWe had a family emergency that required me to drain all funds (savings, roth, and refinance home). Family is everything and anything that is not covered, I will not hesitate to make sure all needs are provided for. I will not owe anyone a debt and have that hanging over me - except for the Mortgage of course.\n\nCurrently, after ALL expenses each month, and being on Disability, I have approximately $350.00 - $500.00 a month to invest. I'm pretty much starting over to build up for the future. I want to invest in Mutual Funds and would like some direction on your program. Also, if you have any other recommendations, I'm open to it. \n\nI have no debt except for Mortgage. Older cars all paid off (2 cars - not a collector of vehicles) and building back up emergency funds for 3 months. I can cover emergencies of a couple thousand if needed here and there. One day we may sell our home, but at this time it is more affordable than renting, or buying a smaller place (Colorado has become out of hand on the cost of homes, apartments, town homes, condos, etc.).\n\nLife insurance is active and paid for by company as part of prior benefits set in place. If anything were to happen, family would be able to handle certain expenses, pay off home, and have money left over along with my wife being beneficiary of $4,000.00/month for life. \n\nWhile I know many are suffering out there and I'm able to have a pretty good life, it came at cost which I have no regrets for. Most of my work weeks were 6 days, and many turned into 7 days. A regular 9 hour day was considered part time. Took pride in my work and that I was able to raise my kids, pay for sports and activities, outside education, pay for college, buy their first cars, and take them on business trips to learn about hard work, working relationships and pride in the final outcome. And yes, would stay an extra day or two to experience and see the sights of different cities. They loved how much those trips taught them about business relationships and enjoying the results of hard work. \n\n I'm worried and do worry month to month. All it takes is a change in cost of living and I'm battling to take care of things. Since this last injury, I have been very nervous about making sure finances are sound. \n\nI rambled a bit, but wanted to give you an idea where I'm at. Like I said, anything you feel you need me to know, do it. Appreciate straight shooters.",

I keep wanting to splurge but keep stopping myself as I don’t like wasting money. Although I did treat myself to a BMW motorbike last year.\n\nI don’t really have a good question …. I feel lost really. Life is good. Money is building up. Time is ticking. And I don’t have a plan.\n\nMy wife and I are both 49 working full time and we earn about  £125k ($155k) each so household £250k ($310k).\n\nWe’ve both been saving through our company pension for 25 years - company contributes 12% of our salary and we add 15%. This started at 12% + 6% but we’ve increased our personal contributions over time. I think we’ll have about £1M each in our pensions when we retire or maybe more …. I’ve not looked in ages.\n\nOur home is worth £1.2M ($1.5M) and is fully paid off.\n\nWe both put £20k into shares ISAs every year although didn’t start this as early as I wish. Our portfolio is half in index trackers and half in funds I’ve picked. Total portfolio now about £800k ($1M).\n\nI inherited my dads home which is worth about £900k ($1.1M) but this isn’t generating any income as my step mother is allowed to live there for ‘as long as she wants’ after my dads passing as per his wishes. This was only supposed to be a couple of years until she moved into one of her houses but she doesn’t seem to be focused on moving any time soon.\n\nWe do spend about £20k ($25k) per year on holidays and £24k ($30k) per year on school fees for our 12 year old daughter and we hope she continues to university. \n\nWe have no debt. \nWe have one paid off car that we paid £50k ($62k) cash for. Our second car is a Tesla on lease but this saves me on taxes as I pay the lease before tax through a company car scheme. Before tax this is £1k ($1.24k) per month but because of my income I’d be paying 60% tax on this money otherwise. Earning between £100k and £125k in the UK is a tax trap.\n\nIn summary, our family net worth is about £2.9m ($3.6m) plus a further £2m ($2.5m) in pensions. We earn £250k ($310k) pre-tax and we’re spending about £60k (€75k) per year.\n\nSo, what do we do? Keep saving, retire, spend more. I have no idea.",

I just put an offer on a small manufactured home. Everything is within my means. But in the process before finding this property I started preparing to rebuild my credit as I had a zero credit score and it was seemingly impossible in my local area to get qualified to rent an apartment or rent a lot at trailer Mobile Home Park without a credit score. I went to my bank and applied for a credit card. And I can't get myself to sign to accept it. My fear is that I go and use the credit card for an \"emergency.\" And then I go back into that like I was in 2015. I don't trust myself, and I'm really proud of being out of debt for close to 10 years. And I know the credit card is only for you a few hundred dollars. But I just feel like that is not really what I want to do and I felt very peer pressured because I have to move out of the family home and about 2 and 1/2 months. I was desperate to establish my credit so that way if I had to find a decent apartment for me and my two children that I have full custody of that I could do so without a fight with property management. I don't have the luxury of time on my hands. But now that I'm two days away from finding out if my cash offer for this property is accepted I told my lender but I don't want to accept the credit card since I still have to apply for the lot lease for the manufactured home park and I've already told them that I have a zero credit score I don't want them to pull my credit and find out that I you know have a different credit score now that I've applied for the credit card. She responded with I've already done the application it's a hard hit so now you have a credit history. Neither of us know what it will look like now. And I just feel like if I do make it into this home the credit card application was unnecessary. What should I do? Should I just accept the card and have it even though my plan for getting it is not possibly necessary anymore. Or should I just want the application expire in 45 days and forget about it.",

    "question_body": "Im wondering what I should do. My fiance and I are both 20 years old. Our income before taxes is about 105,000. We take home about 5,800-6,000 a month. We rent for 650 a month. All utilities paid except power and heat. I have a car I paid 15 thousand in cash for in Sept of 2023. Ive put about 7 thousand in repairs since March 2024 and all its worth in excellent condition is 5-6 thousand dollars. Unfortunately I still need to make repairs on it. I can buy a car but I'd need to pay about 350 a month for a $30,000 Subaru Crosstrek. It's 3.9% interest. 10,000 dollar downpayment (5000 of this being from my TSP and that will be paid back in 48 months once taking it out) I know that a car payment isn't my best option but we live in upstate NY and we get 5 feet of snow at least once a month between November and April. March if we're lucky. My car doesn't have heat, I have a leak in my exhaust, my suspension needs to be fixed and I'm worried any beater car will be just as bad and rusted out due to all of the salt our roads need. I drive between 40 and 100 miles a day depending on where I need to work. \n\nI also found a move in ready mobile home i could put on my parents land in a few years but until then I'd have to pay lot rent of 370, and mortgage of 370. So 740 a month. Instead of using that 10,000 dollar down-payment for a car, should i use it for a 50,000 dollar home? We don't have to worry about furniture because we have all of that covered. This is within walking distance for my fiance's job. It's a 2 minute drive down the road. As for me it is a 15 minute drive from my regular station. And about 30 minutes from the farthest station I go to. Cutting my commute in half and hers into nothing at all.\n\nWe have 1000 dollars in credit card debt that will be paid mid February. 1300 in car repairs that I just pay the shop for, my landlords dad owns the shop so I can do payments with my rent and then we will be debt free. What is your best advice for us?",

    "question_body": "Hello Team Ramsey, I would like to provide some context about my situation. My name is Nick, and I married my high school sweetheart in 2010. Shortly after our marriage, we discovered that I was infertile, which was a significant blow to my wife, who had always envisioned having a large family. To address this longing, we decided to pursue foster care. Fast forward six years, and we ended up adopting all six of our foster children. This was not the path we initially anticipated for building our family, but it seems that God had a different plan for us. \n\nAmanda is a stay-at-home mom, a role that I believe is far more challenging than my own job as an operations manager at Valvoline. Our income is approximately $80,000 per year. Currently, I have a potential side business opportunity that could yield around $85,000 weekly. While this prospect could significantly alter our lives, I find myself feeling apprehensive—not about the deal itself, but about the impact that such wealth might have on us. I hold the belief that money does not equate to happiness, and I am reminded of the scripture in Mark 10:25, which states, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" \n\nAm I wrong to hope for the success of this deal? If it does materialize, how can I ensure that I remain humble? I genuinely wish for this opportunity to come to fruition, but if it does not, I believe I will be at peace with that, as it may be the Lord protecting me from the person I could become with wealth. I am uncertain about how to navigate these feelings.",

I have been in the business for 35 years, it has taken me all over the world, but I've always known I was meant to be in the 'land of the free and home of the brave!'...God Bless America! ;-)\n\nI am a US Permanent Resident as of Feb 2024, looking to remain in USA and become a citizen. (something that will be available to me in around 4 years from now?).\n\nResided Los Angeles 1994-1999 ( few times intermittently since). Worked and paid taxes, but because of so little time in the country expect very poor credit-rating, if any?).\n\nSale has been agreed on my only property, will hopefully have total savings of $170,000 to transfer to Bank of America (California), in around 6 weeks time?\n\nDue to steepening interest-rate rises I was forced to become a landlord to save my home and only investment. I was resourceful, grasping the nettle and renting my flat as a fully managed residence. (I have owned three London properties in total).\n\nVery open to suggestions....but leaning toward buying a family home outright, (perhaps renting it out (fully-managed), finding a centrally located mortgaged apt for myself, so I can work full or part-time. \n\nI have never relied on acting to foot the bills and have turned my hand to pretty much anything during the lean years, of which there are many, and nothing too highly skilled, general factotum, covering costs and putting enough away for those golden rainy days.\n\nThere's only me in this scenario, I have lived minimally and somewhat  nomadically since the early 90s ,so I am happy to spend next decade, maximizing my financial opportunities and slumming it a bit! ;-)...I believe bonafide actors are born speculators and should be made of sterner stuff, so I am willing to do what's necessary, riding out those waves of low to medium risk!). \n\nNot sure what most effective (American) way to do all this is? (what with insurance, taxes, management, building repairs and other costs?). \n\nPerhaps it would be more cost-effective to buy a property outright, live in it as primary residence and invest the rest for retirement?...\n\nI would like to begin working on a plan of action before I transfer the money to my Bank of America account (California)...I am looking for property in these locations, but again very open to suggestions to get best bang for my buck.....Oklahoma, Toledo, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cleveland, Wichita, Little Rock, Detroit, Cincinnati?....\n\nI will have a UK pension (around $850 per month at aged 67) with no fiscal advantage to drawing it earlier or later at this stage). \n\nI don't know much about about the stock market, but I am a quick study and like to learn new skills....So I am thinking mutual funds, bonds, SNP 500? (again, I seek all the good council I can get on this).\n\nAny Help Is Greatly Appreciated.\n\nGod Bless & Thank You For Your Benevolence & Wisdom\n\n                         Joseph Jon Newton",

My insurance would not approve an MRI, after being med flighted to UT medical center and was admitted in Neuro ICU for 10 days.  So the Neuro Surgeon that I was referred to after I was released, ordered an MRI. On Friday I went to have the MRI scan, on Sunday I attended a prayer service at Preaching Christ Church, they placed hands on me and prayed over me. When I left the church that day, my head had stopped hurting for the 1st time since the incident, and that lifted my spirit of belief, I prayed for my brain to heal and if my journey was not over, I would do everything that I can to help make the world a better place. On Monday I visited the doctor to get the MRI results, and he said \"I dont know how this is possible, but there is no sign of aneurysm in your brain, it's clear.\"\nYes, a miracle or a misdiagnosis, I don't know, I believe that God saved me,  for a reason , I have a purpose. That experience transformed me, I have always had a strong faith in Christ, but now, I am filled with the spirit , I want to share love, joy and hope with others. I had a vision of what I can do to help my community , its a project that would help families and children in our country. The Kingsport Kingdom Center is a vision of a place for gatherings, social connection, and physical activity. I am reluctant to share the details, but I would be glad too with you. I would love to talk with you and share my story, I believe God is giving me the courage to message you, and email all the leaders that I have trying to get this project off the ground. \nPlease if you can help direct me in the way to go?\n I also work as an independent contractor as a Notary signing agent. I do closings and signings for mortgage and title companies. I started that business after my brain blew up, and it's growing rapidly. I may have to set up an LLC for tax purposes. I would call my business  A+Agent . \nI have a prayer website called Aspiringinspiration.com through hostinger but its not showing up live, I am trying to troubleshoot. \n\nThe Kingsport Kingdom Center is the project that I believe will unite churches, schools and organizations in our communities, it will bring people together. \n It's needed and necessary.

    "question_body": "Hello, I’m 22 years old and I currently owe about 19k, 7% APR on a car loan from a car I bought about a year ago. The car was about 50k total after taxes and all the fees and I put 50% down on it. I could have payed in full the day I bought it but I was talked into by friends to do a large down payment and finance the rest to build my credit. So right now I have roughly 45k in a money market fund earning about 3-4% APY. I have been thinking about investing that money into a mutual fund and it looks like I would likely earn more than enough to overcome the 7% APR on the car loan so in my head it is smarter to invest the money rather than pay off the car loan. But I just found out about this baby step system and now I’m stuck on step 2.\nEven though I owe this money it doesn’t bother me because I have more than enough to pay it off and I have automatic payments set up to where I don’t even have to think about it. I’m wondering if given my situation paying off the car is better than investing.\nSome more info on me:\nLiving with parents rent free\n2025 will be my first year full time and I’m estimating 150k before taxes\nLooking to buy a home in the next 3-5 years",

We were doing good financially but things have taken a turn in the last 7 months. Big medical issues for both parents including dad who has cancer. Even with insurance and grants, his copays for treatments are multiple thousands and he has 3 each month. Add private nursing care, meds, etc and things are getting uncomfortable very quickly. Our savings are almost fully gone and we've started cutting expenses, but things are still extremely tight. Can't borrow against 401k in my state (state retirement system). Going to sell parents home which they owe free and clear. That should yield about 110k. For our home, we urgently need an extra bathroom, especially with my dads medical needs as there have been several accidents when he needed the bathroom but it was occupied. \n\nSo here are the options we're considering:\n1. Sell our home. We would pocket 120k in equity after paying off our loan. Rent a home with an extra bathroom and pay maybe 1 yr of rent in advance. Then use income to build back additional savings. Once medical crisis is over, Use whatever is left out of the sell of both homes and other savings to buy a home. \n\n2. Sell our home. Use 120k from sale to buy cheap land and a prefab (mobile) home cash. Then use income to build back additional savings. Once medical crisis is over, we can buy or build something more permanent. \n\n3. Use the 100k from sell of parents home to reconfigure our home for an additional bathroom. This seems most risky because we aren't lowering any bills and will have less cash leftover. \n\n4. Any other option I'm not seeing. I will be open to almost anything (except not having my parents with me. That is not an option I'm willing to consider). \n\nUltimately, we need to take some pressure off financially and be able to build our savings back up. And no disrespect to 3-6 months of savings but this situation has taught me that I need to have at least 1 yr expenses because it only takes one medical emergency to almost wipe you dry. Please share any insight you have on how we can move forward! Thank you!!",

I have run my own company since graduating high school, and have been doing pretty well. I only went to school out of my own interest in construction in order to grow my company and become a licensed general contractor. I had a 529 account that funded my schooling. I do not intend to continue my education as I do not feel it will benefit me any more. I now have $30,000 left in my 529 and would like some advice on what to now do with it. Do I just leave it be in case I do decide I want to go back down the line? Because I have no retirement I would like to use it towards investing, but I would also like to pull out some of it to be able to celebrate (although that is probably not the recommended idea lol). \n\nKeep in mind, if I do decide to further my education, I am in a position where I would be able to pay out of pocket if I really needed to.

We are both on SSI neither of those incomes are enough to be taxed and I am 100%disabled so my income from the VA is tax free.  We have very little debt.  I use a credit card for daily purchases such as eating out, gas, groceries, etc.  We have a mortgage at 2.99% and we owe less than 150K.  I am considering buying a $100k life insurance on both my wife and myself.  My quote for the both us is almost $1000.00 a month for the two policies because of our age. (neither of us bought a policy earlier in life of any significant amount) dumb I know.  Anyway now to my question.  My wife and I are both in good health, I am diabetic but other than that nothing more than arthritis.  Would it be smarter to just double or possibly even triple my house payments ($783.00 per month) or would I be better served to buy the insurance and pay the premiums ?  ",

    "question_body": "Hello. I’m 31, married with no dependents. Both of us work full time. We owe $3,000 in back taxes, $5,000 in student loans, $20,500 in a car loan, and roughly $15,000 in personal loans/credit cards ($11,000 of which has been in collections since 2020 when I was struggling financially). Today, household income between the two of us is about $150,000. No savings. We just started baby step #1. Created a budget on Every Dollar and was surprised to see how much money was going to things we can definitely cut back on. I’m a 100% disabled veteran so my wife and eventually kids would be able to go to school for free so I’m pretty sure I can bypass step #5. Our living arrangement is a bit odd but we own 50% of the house and my mother in law owns the other half, but the mortgage is in her name and we pay the rest of the household bills (she went through a nasty divorce and ended up having to get a mortgage to keep the house after her ex took out about $300,000 in equity for himself). If we did end up buying a house later down the line, we would need to add baby step #6 into the picture but for now, that can be skipped as well, but for right now I need to focus on 1-4. I guess my question is more towards what to do about the debt in collections. I live in Florida so the statute of limitations will be met this year. Should I wait another two years for the debt to fall off my credit report?",

  {
    "question_body": "I am 41 married with 4 kids. We have zero debt, house and everything paid in full. Kids go to private school. Really didn’t follow you until a little while ago. \n\nI have multiple businesses that I run. Online stores, wholesale, launching new product line on Amazon and have other private labeling ventures that make good income. This is more a relationship question than money. Although they intersect. \n\nI have been married 13 years. My wife is very frugal and I am not. However, I would never put us in a situation where we couldn’t pay something. My goal for years has been to keep increasing my monthly income. Hence why I reinvest and spread out into other businesses. Sometimes with all the different avenues I have money coming it actually is hard for me to track my actual income. Not a bad issue to have but a headache around Feb when I get to go back and get everything for accountant.\n\nFor years I have felt like I was dragging my wife along. I straight told her at one point that it felt like I was dragging an anchor. One of the things that drew me to her was how driven she was to save and get a house. But once we did that she felt like she made it. I felt like she could have tripped over the door step and still achieved that. \n\nShe does stay home with the kids which I fully appreciate. She does her part there. I have got us to where the last year we averaged between 35-45k a month. We have around 450k in markets. Another 119k in her account and I have around 80k in mine. Plenty of money in the business accounts. So money isn’t the issue. \n\nThe issue is I will get us to 80-100k a month. She is happy with where we are financially and wants me to be more involved with the kids. I set aside Saturday until 7pm to take the kids on my own so she gets a break. I also do go to their games not all but about half of them. They have games back to back because the older two managed to make middle school, JV and varsity. Plus my 9 year old has practice once a week. I also take them to mma, kickboxing and bjj. I personally do those too. I truly believe you have to lead by example. I can’t stand when parents tell their kids to do something they won’t. Especially when it comes to combat sports. \n\nSo we are pretty busy. I don’t know how to get my wife on board with the vision when to her she was content with living a normal life. I think it embarrasses her a little the way I live. Paying off the house in 7 years, two additions along with an inground heated pool that I keep open all year up north. She doesn’t like the fact I have an extensive watch collection. I did legit buy 7 Rolex’s in about 10 months. I did get them retail from AD. So they are actually valued higher than I spent. I don’t drink, do drugs, have any interest in other women, no things that ruin most people’s marriage. \n\nMy issue is everything gets filtered through my long term goal lens. Does this action get me closer to my goals? If it does I do it. If it doesn’t it gets disregarded. When it comes to her or success I know I pick the success financially every time. I have to fix that. I think eventually once the kids are grown we will end up split. Our visions of life are so far apart. She says she isn’t happy in this relationship. I would not be happy living like a normal person. I grew up poor and I swore to myself my children would never know what it is like to use a space heater because their parents can’t afford heating oil. \n\nThat is not in me to ever live like that or anything close to what people call normal. All she wants is to be normal. She would be fine with us both working 9-5 as long as we got to spend time together each evening. I see that as throwing your life away. By the time I am 50 I will have 10 million in assets with 7 figure income. People thought I was crazy when I said I would get here. I think they have learned not to doubt me. I am really good at looking far into the future to see how to achieve my goals. That has always been really easy for me. \n\nI remember I did this leadership training at this place I worked probably 20 years ago. It was this video that had a few different speakers. One guy was a prisoner of war that talked about how he would visualize playing golf while he was locked up. When he was freed someone made a comment about his game. He said he hadn’t hit below whatever his number was in 6 years. It was to point out the power of the mind. \n\nThe one quote that stuck with me two decades was “whatever your obsession you usually get it.” My kids character, their drive in life, teaching them to be fearless, showing them that if you find something in life that makes you feel fear that is exactly what you should do, to use their own unique personality to build their own businesses, to never look at something as a failure, even the most painful moments in life you can use as strength and just being successful in life. I have high expectations for myself and for them. There is never an excuse for being lazy. How to save marriage?",

We paid cash for our car last year when we stopped being stupid.\n\nHousing costs in our area are high and rising.

Use any remaining proceeds after closing costs (optimistically 20k) towards erasing as much debt as we can and chipping away at it from there.\n\nSell the condo, find a rental (cheapest 3brs around us are about 2500/mo).  Use condo proceeds (roughly 80k) to erase our 65k debts and put the rest towards rent.  Wipe the slate clean.  Save everything we can for a year towards a house and trying to make up for lost time with investing/retirement.  Rising housing costs would still be a concern, as would the timetable to save a down payment.\n\nBoth options are attractive and scary all at once.\n\nOn the road to debt free/building equity and in our long term home \n\nversus \n\nDebt free overnight/higher but fixed expenses/no equity\n\nCurious for any thoughts/guidance you can provide.\n",

The good news is that I had my own private clinical practice side hustle.  I calculated the volume of patients I would need to see to offset the job loss and I believe I can reach and exceed that number but it remains to be seen.  Last week my children were in a car accident.  They are safe but the car is totaled.  I bought a second car over a year ago when my eldest daughter was going to commute to college.  We then decided she would live on campus but she still has that vehicle.  The car that my daughter is using is completely paid off.   The car that was totaled has a $19K car note.  Between the auto insurance and the gap insurance, I will not have to lay out any money to pay for the totaled car.  As part of the debt snowball, I was planning on paying the balance of the car that was totaled in the next month.  I have decided to not buy a second car for now.  I am going to use the car my daughter has.  The money I was going to use to pay off the car that was in the accident will go towards my next debt in the snowball and I am guessing my car insurance will go down now that we will have just one covered car rather than 2.  Two Questions:  Should I remove the children from my car insurance until the debts are paid off to lower the insurance further?  When baby step 2 is complete, should I buy a second car, with cash of course so that we have a second car in a household with 4 drivers?  I am the only adult in the house.  The other drivers are my children ages 17-19..   OR should I NOT get a second vehicle until I complete baby step 4?  When baby step 2 is complete I was considering offering to sell the car I have now to one of my children for about $2000 to $2500 so that it gives them incentive to have their own paid for car but again, I am not sure what the timeline should be for me to purchase a second vehicle.\nI am unsure when I will complete baby step 2 as the job loss is new and I have to see what the income ends up looking like as I accelerate the clinical practice that I own.",

If we don't have kids, do we just skip this step? or do we better our emergency fund, regardless of it already having the 6 months of emergency funds. On another note, do you recommend we have a savings account? or should we solely rely on the emergency funds while the rest goes towards our retirement? and with what remains, do we use that to pay extra on our mortgage? Thank you for your time. ",

    "question_body": "I’m am so scared right now and sick to my stomach. I created a Photography LLC about two years ago and never really got anywhere with it. I have a Square account that I used for invoices. Hard times hit and the wife and I were left with no more money. We figured out a way to give ourselves a small loan by using the Square and imputing a Buy Now, Pay Later card info that would deposit the money into the account. Essentially, a way to get money for the time being that we would pay back through the BNPL app. I knew this would technically count as purchase for the LLC because a card is being swiped and money being deposited into the Square account which we would later transfer into our bank. I stopped photography and was able to find steady work doing something else. We filed taxes for 2023 and ended up owing a couple thousand because of it. I’m literally sitting at my computer trying to file our 2024 taxes on Ramsey SmartTax and I looked to add the amount from Square because I stopped doing the back door payment but I know my wife was still doing it. I add the total sales range from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 and I see, “Total Sales: $30,302.24”! I said there’s no way that’s right. I look at the transactions and they have a timestamp. Majority of them are in the middle of the night while I’m sleeping. My wife was using the app on my phone, tapping her phone to it to make a transaction. I’m at a loss for words. I plugged the numbers in to my Schedule C and we owe $6,874. I don’t know what to do. Are we on the hook for this? These weren’t actually purchases for photography. My wife was using it as a tool for temporary loans which are paid back through another app. Please help!",

    "question_body": "I was a co-owner of a business which failed at the beginning of COVID. My home was involved in the financing of the business. My husband and I filed a personal bankruptcy and in the bankruptcy settlement our house is remortgaged to the business loan bank that financed a substantial loan in the business. It was a messy bankruptcy for a variety of reasons and I had no other options at the time. The mortgage is $370,000 and we have been paying $2471 a month. It is a 5 year pay back and there is no interest attributed to this but we have to make a balloon payment on the loan at the end of the 5 years. We are currently 30 months in in the repayment with 30 months left. I’ve spent the last 3 years paying off debts and cutting expenses. So now we have no other debt. The current balance on the mortgage is 338,482. Our monthly take-home income currently is $8879. We have $56000 in savings. I am strategizing how to best payoff the mortgage in the remaining 30 months. \n\nMy husband is retired and unable to return to work due to disabilities from brain cancer that is in remission. He is receiving social security. His SS benefit and a small pension is included in the above income. I am 63 and working full time making 133,000 annually. I have healthy and have great health benefits and plan to work until age 70. I have $122,000 in 401K with employer-matched and my contributions. I have been employed by this organization for almost 5 years. \n\nDue to the bankruptcy, our credit scores are low (621). I am wondering 2 things:\n1. Can I take social security benefit now which would add another $2433 income per month to aid in paying off the mortgage? I’ve calculated that if I do that and include the pension, current payment, $2,000 net from monthly budget, and addition of my SS benefit, we could pay off all but approx $35,000 over next 30 months.The caveat: If I wait until retirement at age 70 my SS benefit will be double what it would be now.\n2. Would I qualify for a mortgage with a Ramsey recommended mortgage company now and get out of this balloon payment commitment and the deadline for payment in 30 months and would plan to continue to put together a focused mortgage payoff as outlines above.

    "question_body": "My husband and I have been married for 2.5 years. We are both 33 and have a 17 month old and are trying to have baby #2 soon. He went back to school before we met and finished while we were dating in 2021. He took out student loans to go back to school and had some from when he went to college right after high school. His degree is in Mechanical Engineering and started a new job in October that he loves. I work full time in retail as a supervisor and have a degree in graphic design but never got much job experience with and have been out of school for 11 years. I was fortunate to not have student loans as my parents were able to pay for my college. I was also able to have a large amount of savings and a decent amount in my 401k by the time we got married. We don’t have any credit card debt the only debt we have is his student loans. We have used some of my savings to pay his student loans and his car about a year ago. We still have enough in savings to pay off the rest of his student loans (~$40,400) and would have about $20,000 left as an emergency fund/savings, but not sure if we should do that since we are wanting to buy a house soon with our growing family. If we pay off his loans we wouldn’t really have much left for a down payment and would take several years to get that built up to a point to make a good down payment for a house. So should we go ahead and pay off all his student loans or keep saving for a house and just make normal payments on the student loans?",

A lot of the things on your website don’t fit my situation.\n\nI have about $1,600 in savings and just under $1,000 in Series I savings bonds.  My thought was to cash these in and put towards debt.\n\nMy income is just over $94,000 (~$5,776 take home).  As part of that number is that $5,000 is for a car stipend.  To maintain a quality vehicle to ensure I get where I’m expected in the region.  Just under $10,000 is for an expectation that I have a gold level health insurance plan through the affordable care act.  Very fortunate to have that support.  My employer has stayed with me through this journey.\n\nI have a pension from the State of Oregon and a TIAA retirement account.  TIAA is just under $100k and the pension is complicated and hard to explain but I have about  $200k in that fund.  Oregon PERS should match that on retirement.  That is if I live long enough to retire.  Pulling any money from the pension requires I pull it all out is my understanding.\n\nDebt wise I have a ‘21 Subaru Outback that I owe $17,500 on at 0.9% interest.  The cars value should be at least what I owe.\n\nI have a primary mortgage that I owe about $85,400 at 2.75% ($897) and a HELOC that I owe $42,200 ($276 interest and discretion on principal)at 7.5%.\n\nMy credit card debt generally is the same each month as I pay it off monthly.  I just use it as a tool.  I know you don’t support that.\n\nI have about $5,000 in medical debt as of today but I know that will increase.  I have met my $1,500 deductible and about $2,600 towards my $7,500 out of pocket expenses.\n\nI was able to raise $3,000 in a go fund me account to help with out of pocket expenses which greatly helped contain expenses last year.  I’ve had at least $1,500 of medical expenses not covered by insurance.\n\nNeedless to say I’m a bit overwhelmed and don’t know what direction I should go.  I worry about when I can no longer work and my employer must move on. I work for a small nonprofit for which I was the only employee until last July when they hired an assistant and some other part time help to help me get through.\n\nCan you help ?\n\n",

I am seeing your content mostly on YouTube, not everything is applying to us (universal Healthcare which is not bound to your job so no surprise expenses there, workers protection so your job is quite secure, free education so I barely know people who go into debt studying  and especially a different cultute towards creditcards and debt make it so you hardly go into debt at all, I think I only know people in debt for housed & car leases), but i really like your general way of thinking about finances and like to get insight from you and your team! \nAbout us, me and my wife just bought a house for 263k€ + are renovating it now for probably another 100k.\nCurrently we owe 150k on the house for buying it + the renovation money is coming from my salary / family will lend us interest free money for that (for the bigger purchases) and we have around 25k saved still.\nPayments are 656€/month, and I can pay off 7500€ additional per year. (You cannot really within the contract pay off more earlier here)\nWe moved to my family's village to have the support with the kid and an affordable house with garden etc. \nI make about 5k net a month + my wive currently gets 1800€/month from the health insurance/state for taking care of our child in the first year (elterngeld), plus I think 255€ for child support(kindergeld)  from the state until the little one has his education or is 25years old.\nWe are otherwise debt free, we don't own credit cards.\nI'm paying into state pension(~670€) + have a pension plan that is taking 185€ from my gross pay, so the 5k net is fully available.\nWhen moving into the village, we needed a car (we only had a campervan before which we also used to travel your beautiful country in 2023!). I am driving 150km/90miles a day 3 times a week to work, so we got a VW ID3 for 25k€ paid cash for getting to work (gas prices in Germany are above California levels) \nNow we are looking for a 2nd car so my wife can be mobile when I'm not working from home (for basics like going to the doctor or getting groceries etc.) \nMy dream car is a BMW E30 from the mid to end 80s. these cars have increased in value in the last 10 years nearly doubled, parts are available and affordable (here in Germany, probably not true for the US as much) and getting a car older than 30 years is lowering taxes and insurance on it.\nWould you say it's wise to get a car like that priced at around 10k, or would you rather buy a car for ~3-4k that probably doesn't have resale value in 5 years? \nAs we are currently in the state of \"renovations around the corner\" any car purchase will simply cut into directly paid off renovations and add to family loans.\nOne thing to add: I know that you often are not a fan of family loans. My sister did the same with my family and my parents did with theirs, my aunt did the same etc. the family overall is not rich at all but doing quite well and money is not a topic for us except for supporting each other to buy a house to live in. I am not concerned about the family situation.\nThanks for reading all that for a simple question and a lot of love from Germany, I hope to travel the US again once the kids are out of the house :D ",

The only problem is that the last step of student loan forgiveness is that i must submit a form in which my current non profit employer certifies that I work there. I have to work 30 hours a week for 1 month before my employer is able to fill that form to have the debt discharged. If I move to a non profit, I will take a cut of $20,000 to my pay.

    "question_body": "I make custom seat covers for Camaros and sell them on the social media sites. I use PayPal as my payment source. I received an email from PayPal that I can apply for a loan up to $8000, but I am stuck whether it is a good idea or not. I have credit card debt that totals $8000 and I want to pay that all off and get out from underneath that huge interest. So my question is, if I accept the loan, they take 30% of each sale I make until the loan is paid off. My usual price for Camaro seat upholstery is $1400, so if PayPal takes 30% of that sale, they get $420 out of the $1400. That leaves me a small amount to order my supplies, doo the job and still have enough money left over for myself/food. That is the part that cause me much fear wondering if I can go for a little over a year paying the $8000 loan back with PayPal taking 30% of each transaction. My payments on the credit cards every month is $700 and that is a problem for me because it is too much money going out in credit card payments with the interest they charge, so my question is, would I be better taking the loan and paying all the credit cards off and struggling through a little over a year with 30% of all my sales being taken by PayPal to pay the loan back or should I just keep making the payments on the credit cards instead. I can't ever pay more than the credit cards ask for because I don't bring in enough money, being I am the only one doing the work. I don't have any employees at all.  I have until Feb. 10th to decide if I want to take the loan or not. Thank you.",

I’m the higher earner in the relationship. Over the past four years, I have overspent, which has led to my partner covering some of our food expenses in only. All other bills have been paid jointly. However, I have now overspent on the baby and my income has temporary dropped and because of this and that he wasn’t aware how much I had spent in the baby, he now wants to postpone the wedding until he feels confident that I can manage my spending responsibly.\n\nI have apologised and proposed that we work together to clear the debt and build wealth once we are married in April together, as outlined in a Dave Ramsey book I have read and advice I got from here as I have only now realised my mistake.

    "question_body": "Hi! My husband and I have been on baby step two for a little while now. While we are working with and try to stay on the budget we are constantly hit with unexpected bills. And now I’m facing a sick mother who lives in a different state that her provider is saying needs to be either put into an assisted living facility or to be with family that can help oversee her care. Currently, we’re in a rental in middle Tennessee. I don’t have the extra money to help her with assisted-living plus I would prefer that she’s with me not out of state. So I don’t know how to deal with this. We don’t have enough to get a home. The rental is almost $3000 a month. They will charge extra if we have to move her in here. I’ve already tried to talk to the company. They’re not responsive. I don’t know how to deal with the situation. My income is  $86,000 a year my husband makes $70,000 a year before taxes. We have the debt, student loans (that are on hold) a sick, aging mother, major health issues of our own, and constant fluctuations of bills that we’ve tried to plan for, but didn’t expect. For instance, even though we’ve put money aside for car repair our one  and only car needs transmission work and even though we put money aside for pet care one of our dogs now needs a surgery. So while we budget and we have monthly cost cover extra expenses, there’s never enough put aside to cover them. The stress is so bad that we’re both trying to find second jobs. We’ve been trying to do delivery and we just don’t know how to get ahead. We have $10,000 in a savings account or retirement accounts or employer funded only both low amounts. We are in our mid 50’s. Since my mom is on a fixed income, a can’t afford to do all this by herself either we’re trying to make that the priority and we are unable to get it to balance with everything else as far as money and advice is really appreciated.",

I have about 32K in my checking account right now.\n\nThe divorce (12 years ago) really devastated me financially for the future. 75K equity out of the home that was nearly paid off, 35K out of my then (401K) valued at 112k at the time. Plus another 83K in child support over the years.   \n\nI own a modest little 1200 s/f home worth 130K, I owe just 15K on the principle at 4% interest. My payments are $338 a month but I pay $720 every month. I pay my annual  $1400 property tax and $1200 homeowners insurance separately. Monthly expenses other than mortgage are about $1300 which are all on a credit card I pay off every month. I tithe at my church monthly and that typically looks like 11.8k annually. I realize I don't have a enough monetary investments at this point. I'm close to paying my home off in a little over a year and was planning on taking that payment and funding a Roth(IRA). I've even considered moving my future (401K) contributions to a  Roth account. I wouldn't take any away from the current balance, just leave it alone until I needed it during retirement if that ever happens.\n\n To retire at 65 would be nice but I'm fairly healthy & active and plan on working until at least 67 or 70.

I don't plan on purchasing a new home but I will be doing some remodeling and large projects to my current home in the future. I will also have to purchase a personal vehicle once I sell my business.\n\nI just want your thoughts on the opening the Roth account or maybe you have some other ideas or strategies I could implement.

I have two credit cards myself but only owe under $100 total on them. My husband makes $16 an hour and I quit my job after having our baby where I made $15 an hour. He did not tell me how in debt he was until after I started staying home. (He was the one who wanted me to stay home. My mom would’ve watched baby for free but he didn’t like that because my brother who lives with mom is not a good person, a felon etc. I also felt a little uncomfortable because he has anger outbursts etc.) My husband owes $13,000 on credit cards (found this out yesterday) and a consolidation loan, a car payment he doesn’t even know how much he has left owing on, and when he took out the consolidation loan, but ended up not using it on the cards. Our rent is $700, and we pay all utilities for a one bed and one bath. He gets very angry talking about finances with me, so I’m in the dark majority of the time until I find this stuff out and each time it’s worse than the last. He never asked or told me he was going to take out the consolidation. I found out after he did and that he had already spent it on eating out, rent, bills, and things he wanted. One thing being a porn subscription which I told him I didn’t want him watching porn, so he canceled it. This is one issue in our marriage, but others not involving money is him checking out other girls and even messaging at least one I know of (I found out because the girl sent me a screen shot of him making a pass at her). He is addicted to porn, which is what he blames a lot of the yelling at me on, his porn addiction. After we had our baby he became a lot meaner towards me and the baby, but after I almost divorced him and went to live with my parents, he started helping me with the baby, doing some chores around the apartment, and says he will try to be better. I told him I only want him to have two credit cards open maximum and if he doesn’t pay off his credit card debt before our baby turns one year, I am going to file for divorce or try to get an annulment for lack of sound mind when I married him.

Looking ahead, we are uncertain whether we will move back into the home.\nNow, we are evaluating our options:\n1. Keep the house - Continue making payments and work toward paying it off sooner.\n2. Sell the house - Use the proceeds to invest in index or mutual funds.\n\nWe are unsure which path would be the most beneficial in the long run as we think after 5 years property would not appreciate more than 10-15%",

We currently have all our debit paid off except for the auto loan ($30k) and the mortgage ($370k @3.375%). Our house would sell for $720k minimum, which would leave us with about $296k.

Part of our \"legacy\" is we have established and contribute monthly to 529 accounts for each of our 5 grandchildren. Each of these 529's is projected to easily exceed $35k (significance of $35K is described below) by the time each grandchild is 20 years of age.\nThe situation:\n I just 'learned 'IAW SECURE 2.0, unused 529 funds can be put into a ROTH for the beneficiary (@$7k / year) for a maximum of $35k lifetime. \nUsing Dave's assumptions (10% return) starting @ 20YO, $7K/ year for 5 years=>$54K @ age 25 => $1.5 million by age 60 in a ROTH.    \n I'm thinking\n1) What an incentive for each to get (and use) scholarships AND choose their college / expenses wisely.\n2) What an amazing legacy...\nMy question:\n Is there any flaw to converting these funds to a ROTH?",

    "question_body": "10 years ago, I bought my first house. 7ish years ago, my finances were \"messy\" and I had $10K* in CC debt. I had ok credit, but I wanted to improve my score to gain benefits/discounts through different programs/financing.  I self educated using Google, and YouTube. I found a few content creators that explained how to used credit cards, to earn rewards, and increase your credit score. At the time, I had maybe 3 cc's, and over the course of a couple years on my journey to a Perfect score, I acquired 20* more cc's. I was using them only to buy what I would already buy, and everything was going great! My highest Credit Score was 847! What an incredible feeling!! \n\nI had been working in the manufacturing industry, as an hourly production worker for a lot of years. May 5th of 2020, I was terminated. I wasn't happy anymore. I spent a couple months soul searching, trying to figure out what I wanted to do professionally. Some of the people I followed on you tube, were Realtors, or had been, and it appeared to be a very rewarding career. So, I took a course, and joined Keller Williams. It WAS the best job I've ever had! I loved everything about it. It was nothing like what I expected, and it was very exciting. I sold real estate for 4 years, and did OK financially, and I had never been happier. But, I want a family, and the partners I had chosen to pursue over the next few years seemed to love my career from afar, until they realized its a lot of days, nights, weekends, holidays, and spur of the moment showings. A family is more important too me than my career, so I took an hourly sales job, which has a consistent M-F schedule, and chose not to renew my license. I had started justifying taking on debt, telling myself it was ok, because it was for my partners kids, or it was ok because I'm investing in the future of the relationship, or that it'll be ok because \"we'll\" figure it out. that relationship ended September 2023, and her and her kids moved out of my home. In hindsight, the relationship needed to end, I wasn't happy with the relationship, I just didn't want to lose her kids. Now I was again solely responsible for all household bills, and my personal debt which was now around $80k in CC debt. I was struggling with my mental health, and was going to sell my house to pay off my debt, to essentially be homeless, because I was so overwhelmed. I got to the point where I had to admit to myself that I could not afford to keep up with all my poor decisions, so when my bank account started to decline my CC payments, I stopped paying everything, except my mortgage, and what I deemed as essentials. \n\nIn late 24' I received a letter from a company I used to work for, telling me that I'm now eligible to request payment of my employee stock. I opted for payment, and have received half of it $42k (the other half to be paid out next year.  Upon receiving this letter, and check, I gained some clarity/awareness of the last 12 months since stopping all debt repayments. I hadn't made any attempt to pay off any cc debt, and it made me feel sick to my stomach.\n\nI decided to fix up my house, and replace the roof. so far I've spent approximately $5,000 getting some work done, and have my roof scheduled to be replaced (estimate $15k).\n\nMy plan is to sell the house, pay off all my debt, and reset in a warmer climate (MN native, want to move to south). A realtor that I will likely use, is suggesting a list price of $280K, and I owed $115K. A friend of mine who I often lean on for big decisions, as he's someone that I look up to, and has what I want, does not think its a good idea to sell my house to pay off my cc debt. FYI he is a real estate investor, has several properties, and is an advocate of Dave Ramsey and Financial Peace University. He told me he wanted to gift me FPU, and I told him that I could afford it....  was $80k in cc debt, and I could afford it. I've reflected on this, and now understand how absurd my thinking can be. \n\nI have built my own Finance tracker which tracks monthly, quarterly, and annual, and started using it a few months ago, and it was surprising to see some trends (manic spending), and just to see where my money goes.\n\nI've also been able to recognize some of my spending patterns/thought processes,  and believe I have Learned to be a \"consumer\", and I don't want to be. I want to live free, be free, and love this life that I've been given.\n\nSo, should I sell my house to pay off all other debt, and reset? Or should I keep my house and pay off all debt more slowly?\n\nI've been selling everything I own, and it feels really good to just get rid of stuff. I had never really done an inventory of my belongings. This has also made me feel sick, as It brings awareness to my spending habits.\n\nI have no car payment, and no mobile device payment.\n\n$80k in CC debt\n$150K in home equity\n$35K in the bank\n\n$70K annual income\nSingle, no kids, 1 Taco Supreme (10 year old Boxer dog)\n\nDrive an 2006 Prius (no payment)",

My debt including my house is $120,000. I do pay a fixed amount on one of my credit cards, $500, in order to snowball that down. That credit card is $15,000. All other debt I pay the minimum. Thankfully my student loan of $25,000 is in forbearance, for now, but it won't last forever. One of my biggest expenses aside from housing and utilities is fuel.

    "question_body": "I have been serving as a church planting pastor for the last 15 years. I am married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and we are raising 2 amazing young ladies who are currently 10 and 7 years old. We live debt free, and our current situation is changing radically and swiftly. Last August I had a TIA, due in large part to previous TBI’s I experienced while serving in the military. My medical challenges have quickly gotten worse and are going to require my full attention. For the last 3 years we’ve been living well enough. Our church has provided our housing allowance and has paid us a living wage commensurate with the location in which we live, Silicon Valley, CA. However, it is necessary for me to resign my pastoral position, which will likely come to an end within the next 60 days. We have $30,000 in the bank, are debt free, and have medical insurance through the VA and OPM.  We also max out our 401k’s each year, I think putting in something like $18K. My wife has been a stay at home boss and homeschool teacher, hasn’t worked outside the home for 10 years. It seems that our church is willing to bless us with a severance of about $110,000. Once we receive that money, we will receive no further income. If we stay in our apartment in Cali, we will blow through that money pretty quickly, so we are thinking about relocating. I do not expect to be employable any time soon. I am 56 years old and my family has always relied upon my income. I am a bit nervous to say the least. Is there any way to make $100K work for us in this situation? Should we put a down payment on a home somewhere? There are a lot of VA facilities around the nation. Anyway, what would be wise for me to do upon receiving that severance? Thank you for your input. ",

We put $300k down on our house (but it was expensive $722k), have a 4.75% interest rate on the mortgage, paid off all the debt, the remainder of our car loans, and filled an emergency fund with about 5 months coverage from our CA home.

    "question_body": "I am 43 year old male. Married to my 44 year old wife of 9 years. We have 3 kids. 7,5,3 are there ages. We live in Killarney Manitoba Canada on an acreage. We are both full time employed. I am an electrician and make about 85k a year. I have heath benefits ,a pension plan. My wife works for the provincial electrical company. She makes 60k a year. Has heath benefits, a pension plan. We have one kid in full time day care. The other 2 are in after school care. $1200 a month for all 3. My father in law has set up an education rrsp for all 3 kids. I have never asked him how much it is for as it is a gift. I have term life and disability. 500k if i die. My wife also has life and dissiblity.  1 m if she dies. This cost us 200.00 a month for the both of us. We also have an insurance policy on our oldest daughter. Equimax estate builder whole life. 100k death benefit, 9k paid up insurance. 109k gross death benefit. We had a family member set this up for us. 64.00 a month premium.\nI have 227k mortgage left on my mortgage. We also have a 15k in a line of credit(6.99%). So total house debt 242k.\nMy wife has a house that we rent. She has 127k mortgage. She rents it out for 1800 has a rental company that takes care of it as we are 3 hours from the house. They take 10% for looking after the property(rent collection,checks on house,service calls) so 1600.00 is what she gets 1300.00 is mortgage and home owners insurance. She keeps 300.00 clear. We have 2 vehicles both fully paid off. I have a boat fully paid off. I have 220k in rrsp and 7800 in a month tax free savings account. Which I see as my back up money. 50.00 every 2 weeks goes to this. Also 50.00 to my rrsp. My wife has 10k in rrsp and she also has 90k in investments.( theses are American funds  as her late father set these up for her and she has an investment manager take care of them). We have maybe  2000 credit card debt but we pay this off in the next 2 months. We use our credit cards for grocery’s, big purchases( car repairs, home repairs,cell phone bills)\nMortgage payment-600.00 bi weekly at 5.7% but is coming due in 2 years\n-wife’s mortgage 6 % coming due 2 years\n- about 1200 a month for food\n-400 for electricity \n-cell and internet 220.00\n- gas 400 a month \n- auto insurance 500.00 a month for 2 vehicles \n- my wife makes 1200.00 A month teaching piano lessons.this is taxed as it is a business because she writes receipts\n- I do side electrical jobs when they come in last year I made about 5k but used this to pay down past credit card debt. I still do them but on average I usually get 3k a year doing side jobs. Not taxed all cash\n- we just went on a trip which cost us 4 k but this was almost paid off that’s the 2 k credit card debt. \n- we plan to have my wife’s house paid off so the kids can use it when they go to collage as our help for them .\n\nMy question is are we on the right track should we use the 8 k to pay off our line of credit.  I worry we are not getting a head and just living pay check to pay check.\n-\n\n",

    "question_body": "I am 37 years old and married to my husband 36 years old. We live overseas in Burundi. My husband and I have different values/opinions about saving/emergency funds mostly coming from our cultural differences (US/Burundian). I moved to Burundi in 2022. I saved around 40k before moving, but we have used all of my savings on wedding, cars, building a small upcountry home (3k) and buying land for my husband’s agricultural business. My husband is 6 months into his agricultural project and we still investing without return. (I know it takes money to make money.) Our income is very low ($800) and just covers our basic needs, tithe, and a small giving budget. We are debt free and our parents recently helped us purchase a home in Burundi worth 65k. We are not currently making any investments or saving for retirement. I do have around 40k (20k rolled into an IRA and 20k in a 401k) in retirement from when I was working in the US.  My question is what do you suggest we should do about planning for retirement? Currently we could invest/save  $50-100 a month. Where would you suggest we make that investment? We don’t know what the future holds for us as far as where we will live in the future (staying Burundi or move to the US) and I want to make sure we are\nprepared for retirement in either situation.\n\n",

  {
    "question_body": "Hi,\nI'm 41, divorced, with two children at home. I work as a special ed. preschool teacher, part time. I do not make enough money to work full time because childcare is so expensive. I drop my children off to school, go straight to work, leave work to just barely make it to the bus drop off to pick up my children after school. I do not receive any kid of public help (I do not qualify), or help from dad other than child support, that is always paid on time.  I do have help from my ex in laws, who are wonderful, but live an hour away.  I do not have any family myself. It is just me. I am trying as hard as I can to be the best I can be with money. My income for work is about 350 a week. Child support is 438 a week. I also own a home, that I paid off a few years ago. I did a rent to own with someone and they pay me 900 a month, this was before covid. I thought I would be able to save and by another rental house but now I can't due to everything being so expensive. My rent alone is 2100! This includes Wi-Fi, water, trash, lawn care, pool, playground and security that I most definitely  need .  It's a very small two bedroom. I own a 2014 Honda CRV out right, it has 1500,000 miles and I'm worried about breaking down. After all other bills, like the power bill, car insurance, phone, food, and medical, I'm left with negative most of the time. I have to start being better with money. My eight-year-old recently said to me \"eat some of my food, I know you aren't eating with us because we don't have enough\". I just broke down.  I didn't think they really would notice that. I eat after they go to bed and it's something like soup because I want them to have something nice to eat, this does not bother me and I do not feel like I'm going hungry, but she is right I do not eat with them because I didn't want to them to notice I am eating something different. After this conversation I realized they were feeling the effects of me not doing everything I can to manage money better. I want to sell my rent to own contract to give us a little safety net and maybe a newer car. My house is worth 250,000.  I do not want to sell it to anyone that will not honor the contact I have with the family living in it now. They are a wonderful family, and I want them to have that house. They have never missed a payment, but are late sometimes, but I have told them I don't mind what day on the month they pay as long as it is onetime a month.  So sometimes they pay on the 20th and sometimes they pay on the 1st, it does not bother me when, as long as its paid. I am very worried about this coming summer as I do not get paid for summer and cannot send the kids to childcare because its more than I make anyway. I made a budget on the Dave Ramsey website and without my small paychecks I am in the negative and even with-it I'm only over by $6.00. When I tell you that I could not work any harder, I mean it. I'm up at 5:45 every day and in bed at 11PM.  Last summer I didn't have money for food and needed to use a food pantry, I almost lost my car but randomly (an answered prayer) the state of NY gave all SpED Preschool teachers and bonus, and I used it to pay off the car. My credit is 618.  How do I fix this mess that I made?  Some roadblocks are: I cannot move out to my children's school district, i cannot go back to court (ive already spent 62,000 at the time of divorce), and I cannot afford childcare.  and I assure you have ZERO interest in ever dating in order to have two incomes. I want to be able to buy a small home so that my \"rent\" is less expensive, is that even possible for someone like me? I also desperately need a new car because if this one breaks down, I won't be able to get back and forth to work, and I don't have any money to fix it. What does someone like me do to help themselves more?\n\nThank you,\nCarla",

I make a little over $100k/year gross (potential 5% raise in March) as a civil engineer. My take home pay is around $5,500 without the side hustles I do (financial coaching, Uber Eats, etc.). I have $45k saved in cash for a house down payment (my 3-6 months emergency fund is separate from this). Based on the 25% rule, I can afford a house (with a 15-year fixed mortgage) that costs around $150k which is essentially impossible in my area (metro-Detroit) without buying a total fixer-upper (not something I am interested in doing at this point in my life) or an older condo. I will most likely be marrying my bf of 3 years in the next year or so (he is in undergraduate college for the next 3 years - will graduate debt free - but will only be able to work in the summers during which he will make about $10-15k each summer). What do you recommend I do? Should I continue renting ($2k/month) and saving for the next 3 years until we have two full-time incomes and a larger down payment saved, or should I try to buy a condo for around $150-200k? Additionally, if I keep renting and saving, where should I be saving my down payment (it is currently in a CD that makes a little over 4.5% annually)? Should I invest it in the stock market even if I want to use it in the next 5 years (max)?",

When we decided that I’d stay home with our child(ren), we only had one and my husband was making 350k/yr. Fast forward to peak COVID we were given the opportunity to purchase his childhood home that his father built.  Fast forward a year into living in the home he was laid off due to the business being under new management.  He is a Real Estate Broker on the side, he made sales here and there and lived off of our savings, and then eventually started borrowing money from his mom.  So fast forward to today, the home is foreclosed on and set for sale on March 11th.  We are going to be filing for bankruptcy any day now.  Once we file we will have an amount given to us to pay plus our monthly payment of $2500.  We do not have any student loans or car loans.\n\nMy question is how do we go about a plan to pay these payments and more? Do we start with the baby steps or something more? I’d love to be able to pay this off within 5 years.  Our total debt; House($408,000), credit cards($20,000) & paying his mom back($8,000) is about $436,000,  he makes right now $83,000/yr.  I am willing to sacrifice that time with the kids, put them in school, and work full-time if I have to accomplish this.  The other problem (in my book) is my husband is big on stock investing right now and we are not on the same page with that.  I don’t agree with it and I don’t want to be the only one willing to hold my feet to the fire if he’s only going to take whatever extra money we have to do this. He is 52 and is in the desperation stage where he is trying to “grow our account” so we can pay the house off. \nI've been listening to your show for 2 days straight now :) and I’m learning A LOT and I’m learning that some of our issues aren’t a math problem because don’t get me wrong before the scales fell from my eyes I will admit the Amazon boxes were coming but since being inspired by some of the stories and visualizing the freedom of truly being present with my kids I’ve deleted my account and the app from my phone. \n\nMy last two questions are because I’ve been out of the workforce for so long that I am not sure exactly what my minimum and maximum pay should be.  I have my AA in Health Science and a Certified Nursing Assistant & Phlebotomy certificate. I also have experience working as a Legal Assistant.  Or should we just sell the home? ",

Thankfully, I didn’t skimp on the homeowner’s insurance and it has since been rebuilt.  Two years later, I found myself divorced, with a teenage son, and no child support from my ex-spouse.  I am now engaged to an amazing woman, with a new baby due in 3 months.  \n\nMy issue is, I am currently in deferment for my house, with the looming threat of foreclosure.  Due to having to fight for custody and to keep my home, lawyer payments, and lack of child support, I am 4 months behind on my mortgage payments.  I chose to pay my lawyer to insure that my child has the most stable home possible, over actually paying for my home.  I also have nearly $4K in credit card debt, a car payment of $410 a month, and no real equity aside from the $30K that I have in my home.  When I purchased the house, the annual combined income between my ex and myself was $134K.  Currently, I earn $77K from my primary job, and around $500 - $1400 a month extra that I earn as an ice hockey official.  My monthly mortgage payment is $2018.  I really could use some advice on budgeting, with what I am currently earning, to catch up on my mortgage, keep my home, and then begin to get out of debt.\n\nI considered re-financing, but due to being in deferment, I am unable to get approved.  I’m completely lost on what to do next.  I have $500 in savings, for an emergency.  My fiancée is really trying to help me, but she only earns $35K annually.  She has encouraged me to be more prudent with how I spend my income, and I have begun to use the envelope system to help with my budgeting.  However, with a new baby on the way, nearly half the income ai once had, and the looming fact that I can only be in deferment for so long, I am beginning to lose hope.\n\nHow can I keep my house, get out from under this debt, and begin to set my children up for a solid financial future?",

I cannot purchase the credits until I’m fully vested but every year the purchase amount is compounded with 6.5% interest and will keep compounding until the total amount is paid off. Doing the math, by the time I able to put 1¢ toward the purchase amount, it will be just about $83,000. That means the first year’s interest would be around $5,400. I’m currently on baby step #2 and plan on being debt free by mid 2026.

Then there's two student loans: $14k 2.5% $56 min, $10k 8.5% $105 min. Now I've got $1800 due the IRS for SE taxes due 4/15/25. I don't mind an installment plan with IRS, but I'm guessing you would recommend I put all my $ to having that paid by the due date, then start knocking out the collection items (making a deal to get the minimum amount they will take), then focusing on the student loans?

I want to pay cash for a small piece of land asap. I've got my $1000 put away and I'm budgeting for Estimated tax payments as well as getting the IRS paid by 4/15. However, the IRS charges a lot less interest than the 8.5% student loan that has doubled from 5k to 10k since 2009. Please confirm if the smallest to largest is still the best option in my case. I'm divorced, kids are grown and I'm living in my camper on land I'm renting from my nephew. I'd really like to pay cash for an acre soon, and I'm not real concerned about my FICO score (I know what you think about credit scores - I took your class!) but I do realize I may need financing at some point although I'd rather just build a small tiny home a little at a time. My FICO score is currently 545. I paid off 2 ATV's in December and got a creditor to take $200 on a $302 collection debt a few weeks ago (I shouldn't have offered so much) so that is one knocked off my report. I'm guessing I know your answer, but I would appreciate confirmation! Thanks so much!\nGina\n",

I have 4 acres of land and my 2 daughters will be graduating and moving out. Even if I can retain $40k for a new home I won’t be able to afford the mortgage by myself. I have 4 acres of land with home. I am 51 years old and I don’t know what to do.

My credit is horrible but I have all this equity in my home that I can’t seem to access. How can I access this equity so I may be able to stay in this home. The land is tied to the house so I don’t know if I can sell the acres or not.

I struggle talking to my husband about money as he lives on a different money planet and not rooted in our current reality of having plenty of money. We want to buy one (or two) \"new\" (used) cars and a boat. We struggle to come up with what is a good amount to spend as a % of our income or however what we want to spend is a good amount based on whatever metric :-) .  He strictly bases it on the lowest amount of money possible and that makes no sense to me because the car becomes something bigger than to just transport ourselves. \n\nMonthly cash flow profit is $3,000 after all our expenses are paid. We have all other bills paid and only $64K left to pay on our house (worth $450K). We have another house fully paid off and serval others that provide rental income. (Have 100% occupancy all the time for the past decade and very seasoned property managers, not novices.) We currently drive a 2014 Chevy Tahoe w/225,000 miles on it (worth a few thousand dollars) and a 2001 Ford F350 with about the same high mileage.\n\nI base the decision on our lifestyle in this next stage in life of what we need the vehicles for (mountain driving/exploring off road) & road trips & possible hauling a boat (to be purchased as well) and transportation for people from our church to/from events. I have 2021 cars in mind but they are definitely pricey now a days with so much inflation! (My dream is to get a 2021 Toyota Tundra TRD Pro and a boat which can be used for income as well/fishing tours, etc.) We have  $43K in cash now and can liquidate crypto for any more cash we need for another car and boat (long term cap gains).\n\nQUESTION: What else do you need to know about our day-to-day money expenses in order to help shed some light on this? We do plan to move in the summer and would like to have at least 1 vehicle purchased by May to drive it to our new city. We do not talk well about money as he comes from a scarcity mindset and I come from an abundance mindset.

(Apologies for the length.)\n\nI know Dave recommends carrying insurance at the value of your home plus... but I am finding it a little confusing because I live in a condominium and we can only take out 'Dwelling' insurance that covers the internal structures of the condominium and HOA is responsible for the external structures. \n\nThat being said, how much would be recommended to take out if the total value of my condo is right around $190,000?  I'm not sure if this information is needed to give a good estimate but I owe about $124,000 and my income is around $58,000 per year. \n\nA very quick back story for further detail...\nI had a total loss from a flood about 7 years ago and I only had about $30,000 of dwelling coverage.  I only had about $92,000 left on my mortgage and I had to cover approximately $25,000 of the damages personally so I took out a HELOC and eventually refinanced them both together equaling a total of a $126,000 total mortgage instead of $92,000. (Since I've been with Dave, I now realize that was a VERY bad move, but already done and learned...)\nI was put up for 3 months and I was informed that my Living Expenses were nearly depleted before the repairs were complete. \n\nOn that note, I am also wondering if I could get a recommendation on how much Living Expense & Personal Property insurance to carry. \n\nAnd just one more factor of interest would be the liability insurance.  I have moved it from $100,000 to $300,000 because now I have a roommate (awesome suggestion per a Ramsey Coach!) but I am wondering if that is enough... or how much I should carry.  (My roommate will not carry her own Renter's Policy but I have stated in the co-signed lease that I am not responsible for any losses that she would be covered for under Renter's Insurance). \n\nThank you so, very much!",

Unfortunately, after multiple tries, she is not getting any contribution match (0%) due to there being no exceptions in changes to the benefit once it has started. Questions is, should she continue to invest at all into the TSP knowing she is getting no contribution and instead put her money into a Roth IRA? Or stay in the TSP and increase to the 15%? Interested in your answers. Thank you again!! Keep up the great work.",

I plan on becoming a financial coach through taking the Ramsey Solutions Financial Coach Master Training, and because I'm extremely passionate about all things personal finance, I have chosen finance/accounting as my major. My parents are helping pay for my college out of pocket (no student loans or any other type of debt involved), and I'm enjoying my college education, but I have a nagging question in the back of my mind. \n\nI know that a lot of employers aren't requiring applicants to have a college degree anymore, and that a degree isn't the only way to get educated on finance and other topics, nor is it the only way to become a financial coach, but isn't having a degree under your belt better than no degree? I feel that since I enjoy learning and can afford to go to college, the decision is justifiable. \n\nIs it wise for me to continue attending college, even though it's not the only option for me to pursue my career path of choice?",
